                <h3>Technique Clinics & Workshops</h3>
                <p>Throughout the year, AARC hosts specialized clinics and workshops that focus on specific elements of sculling. These are often shorter, intensive sessions led by experienced coaches. Examples include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Perfecting the Catch and Finish</li>
                    <li>Blade Work Efficiency</li>

                    <li>Introduction to Racing Starts and Strategy</li>
                    <li>Rigging Basics</li>

                <h3>Private Coaching (One-on-One or Small Group)</h3>
                <p>For highly personalized instruction, private coaching sessions are an excellent option. You can work one-on-one with an AARC-certified coach, or arrange a small group session with a few friends at a similar skill level. Private coaching allows for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Targeted feedback on your specific technique.</li>
                    <li>Focus on individual goals (e.g., improving balance, increasing speed, preparing for a specific event).</li>
                    <li>Flexible scheduling.</li>
                    <li>Video analysis (often included).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Contact the AARC Coaching Coordinator or individual coaches listed on the club website to inquire about availability and rates.</em></p>

    <h2>Finding the Right Coaching for You</h2>
    <p>Consider the following when choosing further coaching:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your Current Skill Level:</strong> Be realistic about your abilities and choose programs or coaching appropriate for your experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Goals:</strong> What do you want to achieve? (e.g., row more confidently, improve fitness, try racing, master a specific skill).</li>
        <li><strong>Time Commitment:</strong> How much time can you dedicate to coached sessions and practice?</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Style:</strong> Do you prefer group settings or individual attention?</li>
    </ul>
