                <h3>Independent Racing & Small Boat Racing</h3>
                <p>Experienced scullers may choose to enter regattas independently or form small boat crews (doubles, quads) with other club members. While AARC encourages all forms of participation, it's crucial to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure you are proficient and safe to race without direct coaching supervision at the event.</li>
                    <li>Understand the rules of racing and the specific regatta requirements.</li>
                    <li>Coordinate boat usage and transportation with the club if using club equipment.</li>
                </ul>
