# Equipment Care Guide

Proper equipment care is essential for safety, performance, and longevity. This guide provides detailed instructions for handling and maintaining rowing equipment.

## Basic Equipment Handling

### Carrying Shells

<div class="two-col-grid">
  <div>
    <h4>Singles (1x)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Carry overhead with hands on the gunwales</li>
      <li>Position yourself at the balance point (typically near riggers)</li>
      <li>Keep the shell level to avoid rigger damage</li>
      <li>When carrying solo, place on shoulder with cockpit facing out</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Doubles (2x) and Pairs (2-)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Two people carry the boat overhead</li>
      <li>Position one person at each end of the cockpit</li>
      <li>Lift and lower together on command</li>
      <li>Both rowers should face the same direction when carrying</li>
    </ol>

### Handling Oars

<div class="info-box tip">
  <h4>Proper Oar Handling</h4>
  <p>Carry oars with blade in front of you, held vertically with the blade up. This protects the blade and prevents collisions with others.</p>
</div>

1. **Carrying**:
   - Hold with blade in front, facing upward
   - Keep the shaft parallel to the ground
   - Use two hands when possible

2. **Storage**:
   - Place in racks with blades facing inward
   - Don't rest weight on blade tips
   - Keep away from foot traffic areas

### Moving on Docks

- Walk, never run on docks
- Keep oars perpendicular to the dock when placing in oarlocks
- Be aware of others and communicate intentions clearly
- When launching, move efficiently to minimize dock time

## Daily Maintenance Procedures

### Pre-Row Inspection

<div class="maintenance-checklist">
  <h4>Before Each Row:</h4>
  <ul class="checklist">
    <li class="check-item">Check bow ball is secure and intact</li>
    <li class="check-item">Verify heel restraints are functioning properly</li>
    <li class="check-item">Ensure all hatch covers are sealed</li>
    <li class="check-item">Check tightness of all nuts, bolts, and screws</li>
    <li class="check-item">Inspect seat and wheels for smooth operation</li>
    <li class="check-item">Examine hull for cracks or damage</li>
    <li class="check-item">Check that oarlock gates close properly</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Post-Row Care

<div class="two-col-grid">
  <div>
    <h4>Hull Cleaning:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Place boat on slings after use</li>
      <li>Rinse entire hull with clean water</li>
      <li>Use soft sponge to remove dirt and algae</li>
      <li>Pay special attention to areas around the fin and rudder</li>
      <li>Dry completely with clean towel</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h4>Interior Cleaning:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Wipe down all tracks with a clean cloth</li>
      <li>Remove debris from foot wells</li>
      <li>Clean and dry seat and seat deck</li>
      <li>Wipe down all interior surfaces</li>
      <li>Ensure no water remains in the cockpit</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

### Caring for Moving Parts

- **Seats and Wheels**:
  - Wipe tracks clean after each row
  - Remove hair and debris from wheels
  - Report any rough movement immediately

- **Foot Stretchers**:
  - Keep heel ties and velcro straps clean
  - Check for proper function after adjustments
  - Clean foot plates after each use

- **Riggers and Hardware**:
  - Check tightness of all bolts regularly
  - Report any signs of corrosion
  - Keep pitch settings properly adjusted

## Oar Maintenance

### Basic Oar Care

1. **After Each Use**:
   - Wipe down handles with the provided desinfecting wipes and remove any debris or tape residue
   - Check for chips or cracks in blades
   - Inspect collars and handles for damage

2. **Blade Care**:
   - Never drag blades on docks or ground
   - Avoid striking blades against hard surfaces
   - Store properly to prevent warping

3. **Handle Maintenance**:
   - Clean grips regularly to remove dirt and oils
   - Report worn or damaged grips
   - Keep handles dry to prevent slipping

## Dealing with Equipment Issues

### When to Report Problems

Report equipment issues immediately when you notice:
- Unusual noises during rowing
- Visual damage to any part of the boat or oars
- Loose components or hardware
- Problems with moving parts
- Water inside supposedly watertight compartments

### How to Report

1. Document the issue in the boat log
2. Notify the boathouse manager or equipment coordinator
3. Tag the equipment with details of the issue if serious
4. Follow up to ensure the issue has been addressed

## Seasonal Considerations

### Cold Weather Care

- Allow extra time for equipment checks in cold weather
- Be vigilant about ice formation on moving parts
- Handle carbon fiber with extra care in cold temperatures
- Avoid leaving equipment outside in freezing conditions

### Hot Weather Care

- Protect equipment from prolonged sun exposure
- Be aware that hull temperature increases can affect adjustments
- Clean boats promptly after use to prevent algae growth
- Ensure adequate ventilation in boat storage areas
