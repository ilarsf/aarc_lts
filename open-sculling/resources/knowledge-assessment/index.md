# Knowledge Assessment

This section provides tools to help evaluate your understanding of rowing concepts, safety procedures, and technical knowledge.

## Assessment Resources

- [Quizzes](quizzes.md) - Interactive knowledge checks on various sculling topics
- [Self-Assessment](self-assessment.md) - Tools to track your own progress and identify areas for improvement

These assessment resources can help you gauge your understanding and identify areas where additional learning may be helpful. They're designed as learning tools rather than formal evaluations, so use them to guide your development as a sculler.
