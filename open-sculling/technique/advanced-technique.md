            <p>You're familiar with the basic principles of rowing. Here's how to refine each principle for more advanced rowing:</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h3>K: Kinetic Chain</h3>
                        <p>Focus on the sequential activation of muscle groups, starting from the legs, then the hips, and finally the arms. This will ensure a powerful and efficient stroke.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h3>R: Relaxation</h3>
                        <p>Maintain a relaxed grip on the oars and keep your shoulders down. Tension in these areas can lead to a breakdown in form and loss of power.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h3>A: Alignment</h3>
                        <p>Ensure your body is in the correct position at each stage of the stroke. Your knees should be in line with your feet, and your back should be straight.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h3>F: Feathering</h3>
                        <p>Practice feathering the oars (turning the blades parallel to the water) at the finish of the stroke to reduce air resistance and prepare for the next stroke.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h3>T: Timing</h3>
                        <p>Work on the timing of your stroke. The drive phase (when you push with your legs) should be quick and powerful, while the recovery phase should be smooth and controlled.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h3>: Consistent Power Through the Water</h3>
                        <p>Aim to apply consistent pressure on the oars throughout the stroke. Avoid pushing too hard at the beginning and easing off towards the end.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>By refining these principles, you'll be able to row with more power, efficiency, and grace. Remember to practice regularly and seek feedback on your technique to continue improving.</p>
