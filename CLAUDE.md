# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains documentation for AARC (Austin Area Rowing Club) Learn to Scull program, organized into structured content for coaches and learners.

## File Guidelines
- Files should be in Markdown (.md) format
- Use descriptive filenames with underscores for spaces (e.g., `Daily_Coach_Checklist.md`)
- Maintain consistent heading hierarchy (# for main titles, ## for sections, etc.)
- Include dates in version-specific filenames using YYYYMMDD format
- Keep content well-organized with clear section headers and bullet points

## Content Organization
- Clearly separate coach-facing vs. learner-facing materials
- Simplify language for learner materials; preserve technical detail for coaches
- Use tables for structured information comparisons
- Maintain checklist format for procedural documents (using markdown - [ ] syntax)
- Preserve existing formatting styles when editing documents

## Document Categories
- Coach materials (Coach_Manual.md, Daily_Coach_Checklist.md)
- Learner materials (Learner_Guide.md, QA_Companion.md)
- Email templates (Email_Templates.md)
- Technical documentation

## Naming Conventions
- Use title case for main document titles
- Use sentence case for section headers
- Use consistent terminology for rowing techniques throughout documents
