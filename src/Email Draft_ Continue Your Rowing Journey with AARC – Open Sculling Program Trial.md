  * Days with Coaches and Assigned Boats

The first request to row needs to be submitted by **Thursday noon, August 8**, so that Tom Kraft, our Sculling Head Coach, can consider all requests and assign boats.

**Practice Information**

* **Arrival**: All scullers are expected to arrive early and launch as a group at the practice start time.To be able to launch on time, we suggest arriving no later than 15 minutes prior to the practice start time.    
* **Communication**: If you are assigned a boat, please attend practice or notify Tom Kraft at [tom-kraft@sbcglobal.net](mailto:tom-kraft@sbcglobal.net) if you cannot make it.  
* **No-show policy:** We understand that plans can change. However, if you miss a practice without informing Tom in advance, it may prevent another rower from having the opportunity to row. To ensure everyone gets a fair chance, those who miss practice without notice might not be assigned a boat for the following week.

**Next Steps**

This trial period is an excellent opportunity for you to continue developing your skills, improve your fitness, and enjoy more time on the water. After the trial period, we hope you will consider continuing with the Open Sculling Program for the rest of the season.
