## Course Overview

### Program Goals & Audience

The AARC Learn to Scull (LTS) program is designed to introduce adult beginners to the sport of sculling. By the end of the course, participants should be able to:

- Safely handle and maneuver a sculling shell independently
- Execute basic sculling technique with reasonable competence
- Understand and follow waterway safety protocols and traffic patterns
- Demonstrate capsize recovery skills (flip test)
- Gain sufficient confidence to continue developing as a sculler

The program is appropriate for adults with varied fitness levels and water comfort. No prior rowing experience is required, though overall fitness and comfort around water are beneficial. The program creates a foundational understanding that can lead to recreational club rowing or more competitive options.

### Structure & Schedule

- **Duration**: 4 sessions (3 hours each)
- **Class Size**: Maximum 6 participants
- **Instructor Ratio**: 1:3 (coach to student)
- **Equipment**: Single sculls, oars, safety gear

**Session Progression Overview:**

| Session | Primary Focus | Key Skills Covered |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Learning the Motion and Getting Wet | Erg technique, equipment familiarity, boat handling, flip test |
| 2 | Basic Stroke Sequencing | Recovery sequence, launching/landing, balance, basic maneuvering |
| 3 | Learning How to Push | Drive phase power, river geography, traffic patterns, pivot turns |
| 4 | Navigation and Working Up River | Skill integration, navigating bridges, longer continuous rowing |

For detailed daily plans, see the individual session plan documents:

### Core Technical Frameworks

Throughout all sessions, coaches should consistently reinforce these essential technical frameworks. For full details, see [Kraft's Keys and Black Bear Sequence](../technical/Kraft_Keys_and_Black_Bear_Sequence.md).

**Kraft's Keys:**

2. **R**: Reach from hips, not shoulders  
3. **A**: Arms straight until legs are flat
4. **F**: Feather after extraction
5. **T**: Tap down before extraction

**Black Bear Sequence:**
1. **Grip and feather**: Maintain proper hand position and control of the blade angle
2. **Release**: Clean exit with light tap down at the finish
3. **Recovery/Catch**: Sequenced return (arms → body → slide) to a prepared catch position
4. **Drive**: Connected power application (legs → back → arms)
5. **Steering**: Regular checking of direction with subtle course corrections

## Coaching Strategies

### Class Management Best Practices

#### Pre-Session Preparation
- Arrive 30 minutes before class to set up and check conditions
- Review session plan and individualize for returning students
- Check all equipment and safety gear
- Review weather forecast and river conditions
- Prepare demonstration equipment on land

For a detailed pre-session checklist, see [Daily Coach Checklist](../checklists/Daily_Coach_Checklist.md).

#### Session Execution
- Begin with land-based review (10-15 minutes)
- Use a structured progression
- Monitor time carefully to ensure all planned activities are covered
- Balance individual instruction with group progress
- End with clear wrap-up and preview of next session

#### Post-Session Tasks
- Supervise proper equipment storage
- Conduct brief feedback session
- Complete session notes for each participant
- Communicate with co-coaches about participant progress
- Address any equipment issues or logbook entries

### Communication Techniques

Effective coach communication is critical to participant learning and engagement. 

For detailed guidance on verbal communication, visual teaching methods, on-water communication, and feedback approaches, see [Communication Techniques](../program_management/Communication_Techniques.md).

### Group Management Strategies

Managing a group of novice scullers requires thoughtful planning and flexible responses to ensure safety and learning for all participants.

For detailed guidance on coach positioning, maintaining group cohesion, pairing/grouping strategies, and pacing considerations, see [Group Management Strategies](../program_management/Group_Management_Strategies.md).

### Managing Individual Needs

Every learn-to-scull group includes participants with varying learning styles, comfort levels, and physical capabilities.

For detailed guidance on addressing varying skill levels, managing fear/anxiety, accommodating physical limitations, and handling flip test challenges, see the [Managing Individual Needs](../program_management/Managing_Individual_Needs.md) document.

## Safety Integration

Safety is paramount in all aspects of rowing instruction and must be integrated into every session rather than treated as a separate topic.

### Equipment and Pre-Row Checks

Comprehensive equipment checks before each session are essential for preventing safety issues on the water.

For detailed checklists covering boat safety checks, oar checks, coach equipment, and documentation, see [Equipment Safety Checklist](../checklists/Equipment_Safety_Checklist.md).

### Weather Assessment

Weather and water conditions directly impact safety and must be carefully evaluated before and during each session.

For detailed guidance on pre-session evaluation, during-session monitoring, and weather-related protocols, see [Weather Assessment Guide](../safety/Weather_Assessment_Guide.md).

### Capsize Recovery Instruction

The flip test is a critical safety skill that every participant must practice and (ideally) master.

For detailed step-by-step instructions on teaching capsize recovery, addressing common challenges, and post-capsize safety, see [Flip Test Instruction Guide](../safety/Flip_Test_Instruction_Guide.md).

### River Traffic Patterns

Understanding and following established traffic patterns is essential for safe navigation on shared waterways.

For detailed information on navigation rules, bridge passage protocols, local hazards, and communication during navigation, see [River Traffic Patterns](../safety/River_Traffic_Patterns.md).

### Emergency Procedures

Being prepared for various emergency scenarios ensures quick and appropriate responses when needed.

For detailed protocols covering on-water emergencies, communication protocols, and shore-based emergency resources, see [Emergency Procedures](../safety/Emergency_Procedures.md).
