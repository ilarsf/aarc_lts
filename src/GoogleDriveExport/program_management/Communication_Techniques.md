# Communication Techniques

Effective coach communication is fundamental to successful sculling instruction. This guide outlines evidence-based strategies for clear, impactful communication that enhances learning, safety, and enjoyment in the Learn to Scull program.

## Verbal Communication Fundamentals

### Instruction Clarity

The quality of verbal instructions directly impacts learning efficacy and safety:

**Essential Elements of Clear Instructions:**
- **Concise Phrasing:** Brief, direct language without unnecessary words
- **Sequential Structure:** Logical ordering of steps or actions
- **Action-Oriented Language:** Focus on what to do rather than what not to do
- **Concrete Terminology:** Specific, tangible descriptors rather than abstractions
- **Consistent Vocabulary:** Standard terms used consistently across sessions

**Delivery Techniques:**
- Pause before important instructions to ensure attention
- Speak at a moderate pace with clear articulation
- Use slightly louder volume than conversational speech (without shouting)
- Implement strategic pauses to emphasize key points
- Check for understanding with brief confirmation questions

**Common Clarity Problems:**
- Excessive detail overwhelming working memory
- Abstract concepts without concrete application
- Too many teaching points at once
- Inconsistent terminology creating confusion
- Ambiguous directional language

**Solution Approaches:**
- Script and practice critical instructions in advance
- Use the "Rule of Three" (limit to three main points)
- Begin with the "what" before explaining the "why"
- Test instructions with novice audiences before implementation
- Refine language based on observed comprehension

### Technical Cueing

Specific verbal triggers that prompt desired movement patterns:

**Effective Cue Characteristics:**
- **Brevity:** Typically 1-5 words
- **Imageability:** Creates clear mental picture
- **Immediacy:** Applicable to current movement
- **Relevance:** Addresses priority technical element
- **Memorability:** Easy to remember and apply

**Types of Technical Cues:**
- **External Focus Cues:** Direct attention to effect of movement (e.g., "Push the footboard away")
- **Internal Focus Cues:** Direct attention to body position/movement (e.g., "Keep shoulders relaxed")
- **Rhythm Cues:** Establish timing patterns (e.g., "Slow... quick... slow")
- **Sensation Cues:** Highlight feeling of correct execution (e.g., "Feel the connection")
- **Analogical Cues:** Use familiar comparisons (e.g., "Hands like hooks, not fists")

**Cue Development Process:**
1. Identify the specific technical element needing attention
2. Determine most direct sensory pathway for addressing it
3. Create multiple potential cue options (4-5 alternatives)
4. Test effectiveness with different learners
5. Refine and standardize most effective options
6. Document successful cues for consistent usage

**Cue Delivery Timing:**
- **Preparatory:** Before the movement begins
- **Concurrent:** During the execution
