# Equipment Maintenance Guide

Proper care and maintenance of rowing equipment extends its lifespan, ensures safety, and contributes to a positive experience for all club members. This guide outlines essential procedures for everyday equipment care, storage, and reporting issues.

## Daily Cleaning and Handling

### Boat Cleaning Procedure

**After Each Row:**
1. Place boat securely in slings/stretchers
2. Use clean, soft towels/rags to wipe down:
   - Entire hull exterior (top and bottom)
   - Inside of cockpit area
   - Foot stretcher board and tracks
   - Seat and seat wheels
   - Riggers and oarlocks
3. Pay special attention to:
   - Water collection points (bow/stern tank areas)
   - Seat tracks (where debris accumulates)
   - Foot stretcher area (where dirt collects)
   - Ventilation ports (ensure they're clear)

**Cleaning Guidelines:**
- Use only fresh water for regular cleaning
- Only use approved cleaning products if specified by boathouse
- Never use abrasive materials on hull surfaces
- Wipe in the direction of the hull (bow to stern) to avoid scratching
- Remove shoe grime and track debris completely

**Special Situations:**
- After rowing in algae-heavy water: extra attention to hull bottom
- Muddy launching conditions: check for mud on hull/shoes/interior

### Oar Care

**After Each Row:**
1. Rinse blades with fresh water if available
2. Wipe down:
   - Blade surfaces completely
   - Shaft
   - Sleeve/collar area
   - Handle (with disinfectant wipe/spray)
3. Inspect for:
   - Chips or cracks in blades
   - Loose collars/buttons
   - Handle grip condition
   - Shaft integrity

**Handle Hygiene:**
- Disinfect handles after each use
- Remove any tape completely (no residue)
- Never use petroleum products on handles
- Report worn or damaged handle surfaces

**Storage Position:**
- Return to appropriate rack
- Place with correct orientation (club-specific)
- Secure properly to prevent rolling/falling
- Blade placement as designated by club policy

## Proper Storage Techniques

### Hull Storage

**Rack Placement:**
1. Check for correct rack assignment (identify your boat's designated spot)
2. Position hull with:
   - Proper bow/stern orientation
   - Riggers aligned with neighboring boats
   - Weight distributed evenly on rack supports
3. Secure with straps if provided:
   - Not too tight (can deform hull)
   - Not too loose (allows movement)
   - No metal buckles contacting hull

**Key Considerations:**
- Always place hull on designated padding/supports
- Ensure riggers are properly aligned to avoid interference
- Verify hull is fully supported on both bow and stern rack points
- Double-check that hull is completely secure before leaving

### Proper Lifting and Carrying

**Basic Principles:**
- Always use proper lifting technique (legs, not back)
- Use appropriate number of people for boat weight
- Communicate clearly during all phases of movement
- Be aware of riggers, obstacles, and other people
- Maintain control at all times

**Number of Carriers Needed:**
- Singles: 1-2 people
- Doubles: 2-4 people
- Quads: 4-6 people
- Eights: 8+ people

**Standard Commands:**
- "Hands on" - Prepare to lift
- "Up to waist/shoulders" - Lift to specified height
- "Walk it forward/back" - Move in specified direction
- "Heads up" - Alert to overhead obstacles
- "Up/down to shoulders/rack" - Change carrying position

## Identifying and Reporting Issues

### Pre-Row Check

Before each row, conduct a brief but thorough equipment check:

**Critical Safety Components:**
1. **Bow ball:** Securely attached, undamaged
2. **Heel restraints:** Functioning properly, secure
3. **Hull integrity:** No cracks, holes, or significant damage
4. **Rigger attachment:** All bolts tight, no movement
5. **Foot stretcher:** Securely fastened, adjustable
6. **Seat function:** Moves smoothly on tracks

**Performance Components:**
1. **Tracks:** Clean and undamaged
2. **Oarlocks:** Open/close properly, pins secure
3. **Wheels:** All present and turning freely
4. **Ventilation plugs:** Present and functional
5. **General cleanliness:** Boat ready for use

### Reporting Protocol

When equipment issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate Assessment:**
   - Determine if issue affects basic safety/function
   - Decide if boat should be taken out of service

2. **Documentation:**
   - Record issue in club's maintenance log/system
   - Include:
     - Date and time
     - Boat name/number
     - Specific problem location
     - Description of issue
     - Your name and contact information
   - Take photo if helpful

3. **Notification:**
   - Tag boat with proper maintenance tag if available
   - Inform:
     - Boathouse manager/staff
     - Coach
     - Fleet manager (if applicable)
   - Follow club-specific notification procedure

4. **Follow-up:**
   - Check status if using boat in near future
   - Verify repairs if you reported significant issues

**[PLACEHOLDER: Insert club-specific process for maintenance requests]**

### Common Issues and Descriptions

When reporting problems, use specific terminology:

| Issue | Description Example | Severity |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| **Loose rigger** | "Starboard rigger loose at inboard bolt" | High - Safety |
| **Seat not rolling** | "Seat sticks at position 15cm from full compression" | Medium - Function |
| **Oarlock gate issue** | "Port oarlock gate won't close completely" | High - Safety |
| **Hull damage** | "2cm crack on port side near bow" | High - Safety |
| **Missing parts** | "Ventilation plug missing from stern compartment" | Medium - Function |
| **Foot stretcher** | "Starboard side foot stretcher screw stripped" | Medium - Function |
| **Track debris** | "Metal shaving embedded in port side track" | Low - Maintenance |

## Basic Adjustments

### Foot Stretcher Adjustment

**Standard Procedure:**
1. Locate adjustment mechanism (varies by boat type)
2. Loosen securing nuts/bolts (typically inside hull)
3. Slide foot stretcher to desired position
4. Ensure both sides remain equal distance from fixed point
5. Retighten securely
6. Test stability before rowing

**Optimal Setting:**
- At the finish, handle should cross the body at mid-ribcage
- At the catch, shins should be vertical or nearly vertical
- Foot position should allow comfortable full compression
- Typically 42-45 degrees from horizontal

### Oarlock Height

**Indicators for Adjustment:**
- Handles too high/low at finish
- Difficulty clearing water on recovery
- Digging/washing out consistently
- Shoulder discomfort or asymmetry

**Club Policy:**
- **[PLACEHOLDER: Insert club policy on who may adjust oarlock heights]**
- Typically requires specialized tools and knowledge
- May need supervisor/coach approval
- Record changes in boat log

## Seasonal Maintenance

### Weather Considerations

**Hot Weather:**
- Ensure hull ventilation plugs are open when stored
- Wipe down thoroughly to prevent mildew
- Keep boats out of direct sunlight when not in use
- Be vigilant about track cleaning (sweat accelerates corrosion)

**Cold Weather:**
- Prevent water from freezing in hull compartments
- Check for contraction of components in extreme cold
- Take extra care with composite materials (more brittle)
- Watch for ice formation on moving parts

**Transition Seasons:**
- Be vigilant about changing conditions
- More frequent checking of heel restraints (temperature changes affect material)
- Inspect storage areas for seasonal issues (leaks, etc.)
- Prepare for seasonal fleet rotation if applicable

### Deep Cleaning Protocol

**[PLACEHOLDER: Club-specific seasonal cleaning schedule and responsibilities]**

**Typical Tasks:**
- Remove all loose hardware and clean individually
- Clean and lubricate seat wheels
- Deep clean tracks
- Inspect and tighten all rigger bolts
- Check and replace heel restraints if needed
- Thoroughly clean ventilation areas and compartments
- Touch up small hull scratches if appropriate
- Verify all boat information/identification is legible
