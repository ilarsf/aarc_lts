# Glossary of Rowing Terms

This glossary provides definitions for essential terminology used in sculling instruction. These terms are organized by category to help beginners build a comprehensive understanding of rowing vocabulary.

## Boat Parts and Equipment

### Hull Components

**Bow** — The forward end of the boat (crosses finish line first). Often has a small white ball (bow ball) attached for safety.

**Stern** — The rear end of the boat.

**Port** — The left side of the boat when facing the bow (rower's right).

**Starboard** — The right side of the boat when facing the bow (rower's left).

**Gunwales** (or **Gunnels**) — The top edges of the boat's sides.

**Hull** — The main body of the boat.

**Deck** — The covered portions at the bow and stern of the shell.

**Keel** — The centerline of the boat's bottom.

**Bow Ball** — The small rubber ball (minimum 4cm diameter) attached to the bow for safety purposes.

**Splashboard** (or **Splash Deck**) — Small raised portion at the bow to prevent water from splashing in.

**Skeg** (or **Fin**) — Small fin on the bottom near the stern that helps with tracking and directional stability.

**Shoes/Footstretcher** — The adjustable assembly where the rower places their feet, including shoes or foot plates and straps.

**Heel Restraints** — Straps that limit how far the heels can rise, allowing quick foot extraction during a capsize.

**Seat** — The sliding seat on which the rower sits.

**Tracks** (or **Slides**) — The rails on which the seat moves.

**Wheels** — The small wheels on the bottom of the seat that roll in the tracks.

### Rigging Components

**Rigger** — Metal framework extending from the gunwale to hold the oarlock.

**Oarlock** (or **Gate**) — Device on the rigger that holds the oar and allows it to pivot.

**Pin** — Vertical post on the rigger that holds the oarlock.

**Top-Nut** — Nut that secures the oarlock to the pin.

**Backstay** — Support bar connecting the rigger to the hull for added stability.

**Pitch** — The angle of the oarlock relative to the boat, affecting how the blade enters the water.

**Spread** — The distance from the center of the boat to the oarlock.

**Height** — The height of the oarlock above the seat.

**Work-through** — Distance from the face of the oarlock to the center of the boat.

### Oar Components

**Oar** — Lever used to propel the boat (includes shaft, sleeve, collar, blade).

**Blade** — Flat part of the oar that enters the water.

**Spoon** — The curved face of the blade.

**Shaft** — The main body of the oar between the handle and the sleeve.

**Handle** — Part of the oar the rower holds.

**Grip** — The part of the handle where the rower's hands are placed.

**Sleeve** — Plastic sleeve around the shaft where it contacts the oarlock.

**Collar** (or **Button**) — Plastic ring around the oar that rests against the oarlock and sets the outboard length.

**Inboard** — The distance from the end of the handle to the collar.

**Outboard** — The distance from the collar to the tip of the blade.

## Rowing Technique

### Phases of the Stroke

**Catch** — The moment the blade enters the water at the start of the drive.

**Drive** — The power phase of the stroke when the blade is in the water.

**Finish** (or **Release**) — The end of the drive when the blade is removed from the water.

**Recovery** — The phase of the stroke when the blade is out of water, returning to the catch position.

**Layback** — The amount of backward lean at the finish of the stroke.

**Rock Over** — The forward pivot of the body from the hips during the recovery.

### Blade Actions

**Feather** — Turning the oar blade parallel to the water surface (during recovery).

**Square** — Turning the oar blade perpendicular to the water surface (for the drive).

**Bury** — Submerging the blade to the proper depth in the water.

**Washing Out** — When the blade is not fully buried or comes out of the water during the drive.

**Digging** — When the blade goes too deep into the water.

**Skying** — When the blade is too high off the water during the recovery.

**Crab** (or **Catching a Crab**) — When the blade gets caught in the water, often causing the handle to hit the rower.

**Tap Down** — Slight downward pressure on the handles at the finish to extract the blades cleanly.

### Body Positions & Movement

**Compression** — The amount of leg bend at the catch.

**Reach** — The distance the rower reaches forward at the catch.

**Body Angle** — The forward lean from the hips at the catch position.

**Body Swing** — The movement of the torso during the drive and recovery.

**Hands Away** — The initial movement of the hands away from the body after the finish.

**Foot Pressure** — Force applied against the footstretcher during the drive.

**Set** (or **Balance**) — Keeping the boat level and stable.

**Ratio** — The relationship between the time taken during the drive and recovery (typically 1:2).

**Rating** (or **Stroke Rate**) — The number of strokes taken per minute (SPM).

**Outside Arm** — In sculling, the arm furthest from the rigger for each hand.

**Inside Arm** — In sculling, the arm closest to the rigger for each hand.

**Connection** — The feel of the blade locked in the water during the drive.
