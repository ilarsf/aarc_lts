# Flip Test Instructions


## Objective

Learn how to recover from a capsize and re-enter the scull safely.

<div class="info-box note">
  <h4>Why Practice This?</h4>
  <p>Practicing capsize recovery in a controlled environment builds confidence and ensures you're prepared for an unexpected situation on the water. This is an essential safety skill for all rowers.</p>
</div>

## Capsize

1. Purposefully flip the boat to understand the sensation and practice recovery.  
2. Remain calm and orient yourself in the water.

## Right the Boat

<div class="two-col-grid">
  <div>
    <p>If your boat is completely turned over:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Approach the overturned scull from the side.</li>
      <li>Reach across the hull (bottom) of the boat to the far side and grab the gunwale (the top edge of the boat).</li>
      <li>Slowly pull the boat towards you to right it. Watch out for the oars as the boat flips back over.</li>
    </ol>

</div>

## Position the Oars

<div class="info-box tip">
  <h4>Stability is Key</h4>
  <p>Properly positioned oars create a stable platform that makes re-entry much easier. Take the time to get this step right.</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Arrange the near side oar perpendicular to the boat with the blade flat on the water.</li>
      <li>Do the same with the far side oar. If the second oar is not cooperating, swim around the boat (or dive under it, but watch out for the rigger) to sort it out to avoid losing it or struggling to grab it.</li>
      <li>Ensure both oars are feathered (blades flat).</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

## Re-entering the Boat

<div class="three-col-grid">
  <div>
    <h4>Preparing for Re-entry</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Overlap the two oar handles and grasp them with the hand closest to the stern.</li>
      <li>Place your other hand on the center strip.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="image-placeholder">
      <div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-image"></i></div>
      <div class="title">Hand Position</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h4>The Kick & Hip Lift</h4>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>Boost yourself out of the water by pushing down on the oar handles and the center strip.</li>
      <li>Use a strong scissor kick to lift your hips onto the boat.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="image-placeholder">

      <div class="title">Kick Technique</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h4>Getting Seated</h4>
    <ol start="5">
      <li>Twist your hips and sit down.</li>
      <li>Immediately lift the hand holding the oar handles and get the blades flat on the water for stability.</li>
      <li>Get your butt back on the seat.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="image-placeholder">
      <div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-image"></i></div>
      <div class="title">Final Position</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="info-box warning">
  <h4>Helpful Tip</h4>
  <p>Sometimes it helps to put your legs out the sides and lean forward to lift your butt, then pull the seat under you and bring your legs back into the boat.</p>
</div>

## Post-Recovery

1. Once back in the boat, take a moment to stabilize and regain balance.  
2. Ensure the oars are properly positioned and that you are seated correctly.  
3. Signal to the coach or support boat that you are ready to continue.

## Additional Tips

<div class="two-col-grid">
  <div>
    <h4>Alternative Approach</h4>
    <p>If re-entry is difficult, swim towards the shore to a shallow area where you can stand. This can make re-entry easier, though the riverbed may be muddy and soft.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h4>Practice Makes Perfect</h4>
    <p>The more you practice the flip test, the more comfortable you will become with the recovery process. Stay calm and collected - panic can make the recovery process more difficult.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="info-box note">
  <h4>Use Controlled Movements</h4>
  <p>Once you're back in the boat, make slow and deliberate movements to avoid tipping the boat again. The boat will be less stable with water in it.</p>
