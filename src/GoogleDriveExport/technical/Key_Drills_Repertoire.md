# Key Drills Repertoire

This comprehensive guide provides detailed explanations of all recommended drills for the AARC Learn to Scull program. Drills are organized by focus area to help coaches select appropriate exercises for specific skill development.

## Recovery Phase Drills

### Pick Drill (Erg & Water)

**Purpose:** Builds the recovery sequence from finish to catch, establishing proper sequencing and body position.

**Execution:**
1. Start at the finish position (legs flat, slight body layback, arms drawn to lower ribs)
2. Progress through these stages, spending 10-15 strokes on each:
   - **Arms Only:** Extend arms away from body to full reach without changing body angle or slide position
   - **Arms + Body:** Add the forward pivot from the hips after arms are away
   - **Arms + Body + Half Slide:** Add half-slide movement after body has pivoted forward
   - **Full Stroke:** Complete the entire stroke with full slide

**Coaching Points:**
- Emphasize clean hand movement away from body FIRST
- Ensure body pivot is complete BEFORE knees bend
- Maintain consistent hand heights throughout
- Focus on smooth transitions between segments
- Watch for rushing - recovery should be controlled

**Progression Options:**
- Begin on ergometer before attempting on water
- Use a mirror or partner observation to check form
- Add pauses between segments if needed
- Reduce pressure to focus on technique

**Common Errors and Corrections:**
- **Error:** Bending knees before hands are away/body is over
  - **Correction:** "Hands away FIRST, body rock SECOND, slide THIRD"
- **Error:** Dropping hands after finish
  - **Correction:** "Maintain horizontal pressure on the handle"
- **Error:** Rushing the movement sequence
  - **Correction:** "Slow hands away, feel the boat run"

---

### Pause Drills

**Purpose:** Enhances body awareness and control during recovery. Reinforces correct sequencing and develops patience.

**Execution:**
Insert distinct pauses (1-2 seconds) at key points during the recovery:

1. **Arms Away Pause:** Pause immediately after the release, once hands have cleared the knees
2. **Body Over Pause:** Pause after arms are extended and body has pivoted forward, before knees bend
3. **Half-Slide Pause:** Pause halfway up the slide to check body position
4. **Catch Pause:** Pause at the catch position with blade squared before entry

**Coaching Points:**
- Use verbal cadence to reinforce: "Pull... Away (pause)... Body (pause)... Slide..."
- Emphasize complete pause - no movement during the hold
- Check body position during each pause
- Maintain proper posture and relaxation during pauses
- Focus on the transition after each pause

**Progression Options:**
- Begin with single-pause exercises, then combine multiple pauses
- Start at low pressure, gradually increase as control improves
- Begin on erg for understanding, then transfer to water
- Progress to "Quick Pause" variations with briefer stops

**Common Errors and Corrections:**
- **Error:** Moving during the pause
  - **Correction:** "Freeze completely during the pause"
- **Error:** Losing posture during pause
  - **Correction:** "Check your body position - core engaged, shoulders relaxed"
- **Error:** Rushing after the pause
  - **Correction:** "Smooth acceleration after each pause"

### Square Blade Rowing

**Purpose:** Builds blade control and balance. Simplifies technique for beginners while improving feel for proper blade depth.

**Execution:**
1. Row without feathering the blades (keep them squared/perpendicular to water throughout stroke)
2. Begin with arms-only rowing to establish control
3. Progress to full stroke with blades remaining squared
4. Focus on clean entry and exit
5. Maintain consistent blade depth

**Coaching Points:**
- Start with minimal pressure
- Emphasize horizontal movement of hands
- Focus on precise hand heights
- Ensure blades clear water completely on recovery
- Drive for clean, splash-free entries and exits

**Progression Options:**
- Begin at the dock or in very calm water
- Start with 10-stroke pieces, gradually extending
- Introduce brief feathering only at the finish, returning to square immediately
- Progress to "Alternate 10" - 10 strokes squared, 10 strokes feathered

**Common Errors and Corrections:**
- **Error:** Catching water during recovery
  - **Correction:** "Hands slightly higher on recovery"
- **Error:** Uneven blade depths
  - **Correction:** "Find the same resistance in both hands"
- **Error:** Hesitation before catch due to anxiety about entry
  - **Correction:** "Confidence at the catch - commit to the entry"

## Drive Phase Drills

### Reverse Pick Drill (Erg & Water)

**Purpose:** Isolates and emphasizes leg drive as the primary power source. Teaches rowers to connect effectively at the catch.

**Execution:**
1. Start at the catch position (legs compressed, body forward, arms extended)
2. Progress through these stages, spending 10-15 strokes on each:
   - **Legs Only:** Drive with legs while keeping arms straight and body angle constant
   - **Legs + Back:** Add back swing after legs are halfway down
   - **Full Stroke:** Add arm pull for complete stroke

**Coaching Points:**
- Emphasize pressure starting from the feet
- Maintain consistent forward body angle during initial leg drive
- Focus on straight arms until legs are nearly flat
- Feel the "connection" or "hang" off the handle
- Drive horizontally rather than vertically

**Progression Options:**
- Begin on ergometer to establish understanding
- Use mirror or partner observation for feedback
- Start with light pressure, gradually increase
- Use "ten stroke transition" between phases

**Common Errors and Corrections:**
- **Error:** Opening back too early (bum shoving)
  - **Correction:** "Maintain forward body angle as legs start to drive"
- **Error:** Pulling with arms too early
  - **Correction:** "Arms are just hooks - let the legs do the work"
- **Error:** Insufficient leg compression at catch
  - **Correction:** "Get your shins vertical for maximum power"

### Quarter-Slide Rowing

**Purpose:** Limits range of motion to focus on technical precision and connection without the complexity of full slide.

**Execution:**
1. Row with compressed range of motion (slides only 1/4 of normal distance)
2. Focus on clean catches and efficient power application
3. Emphasize quick connection at catch
4. Maintain good body sequence despite shortened stroke

**Coaching Points:**
- Keep shins vertical at the catch
- Focus on immediate leg drive connection
- Maintain consistent rhythm and timing
- Emphasize clean finishes despite shorter stroke
- Watch for good sequencing despite compressed range

**Progression Options:**
- Begin with arms-only, then add quarter slide

- Alternate sets: 10 strokes quarter-slide, 10 strokes half-slide
- Gradually extend to full slide when ready

**Common Errors and Corrections:**
- **Error:** Rushing despite shortened slide
  - **Correction:** "Same timing, shorter distance"
- **Error:** Poor body preparation despite shorter distance
  - **Correction:** "Still need full rock-over despite shorter slide"
- **Error:** Pulling with arms to compensate for shorter stroke
  - **Correction:** "Push, don't pull - legs still the power source"

---

### Legs-Only Pressure Builds

**Purpose:** Isolates leg drive to develop awareness of leg power and connection.

**Execution:**
1. Row with straight arms and constant body angle throughout
2. Focus exclusively on leg drive
3. Begin with light pressure (30%)
4. Gradually increase pressure in 10% increments
5. Focus on maintaining technique as pressure increases

**Coaching Points:**
- Maintain consistent body angle throughout
- Keep arms straight as tension cables
- Feel pressure building from feet
- Focus on smooth, even acceleration
- Keep blade depth consistent as pressure increases

**Progression Options:**
- Begin on erg to establish feel
- Start with 10-stroke pieces at each pressure level
- Progress to "ladder" approach: 10 at 30%, 10 at 40%, 10 at 50%, etc.
- Add "countdown" approach: 10 at highest pressure, 9 at slightly less, etc.

**Common Errors and Corrections:**
- **Error:** Breaking form as pressure increases
  - **Correction:** "Only add pressure you can control"
- **Error:** Pulling with arms or back to generate more force
  - **Correction:** "The increase comes only from legs"
- **Error:** Digging blades deeper as pressure increases
  - **Correction:** "Same blade depth, more horizontal pressure"

## Blade Control Drills

### Ghost Strokes

**Purpose:** Builds initial confidence in oar control in a stable environment before open water rowing.

**Execution:**
1. With boat secured at dock (or coach stabilizing), practice minimal-pressure strokes
2. Focus on handle movement and blade work without actual boat movement
3. Practice feathering and squaring with precise timing
4. Feel how oar movements affect boat stability
5. Develop sense of blade depth without pressure concerns

**Coaching Points:**
- Focus on light grip and relaxed shoulders

### Advanced Feathering Drill

**Purpose:** Develops precise blade control and clean feathering/squaring technique.

**Execution:**
1. Row with focus on crisp, clean feathering after extraction
2. Count specific timing for feathering:
   - "Pull, Tap, Away, Feather" - with distinct timing for each
3. Practice squaring timing before catch:
   - Begin squaring early, complete just before entry
4. Focus on wrist movement rather than full arm rotation

**Coaching Points:**
- Feather only after handle has cleared water
- Use primarily wrist action, not forearm rotation
- Square gradually, not in a single jerky movement
- Maintain level hands throughout feathering/squaring
- Feel the mechanical advantage of the oarlock

**Progression Options:**

### Pivot Turns (One Backing/One Rowing)

**Purpose:** Develops more advanced turning capability for maneuvering in confined spaces or executing quick direction changes.

**Execution:**
1. To execute a sharp turn (e.g., 180 degrees):
   - Back (push) with one oar: handle moves away from body
   - Row (pull) with the other oar: normal rowing motion
2. For tighter turns, back more strongly than rowing
3. For gentler arcs, apply more pressure to rowing oar
4. Blade on backing oar can be partially squared for more resistance

**Coaching Points:**
- Begin with very light pressure on both oars
- Backing hand should be slightly higher than normal
- Look in the direction of the turn
- Keep backing blade partially squared for effect
- Coordinate pressure between oars for smooth rotation

**Progression Options:**
- Start with stationary pivot turn (boat spinning in place)
- Progress to moving pivot turns
- Add precision challenges (turn within specific area)
- Practice emergency stops using backing pressure on both oars

**Common Errors and Corrections:**
- **Error:** Backing oar digging too deep
  - **Correction:** "Higher hands on backing oar"
- **Error:** Insufficient backing pressure for effect
  - **Correction:** "Push that handle away more firmly"
- **Error:** Uncoordinated pressure between oars
  - **Correction:** "Equal and opposite forces for a clean pivot"

**Common Errors and Corrections:**
- **Error:** Cutting corners on turns
  - **Correction:** "Take wide turns, maintain your 'lane'"
- **Error:** Forgetting to check position regularly
  - **Correction:** "Look every 5 strokes - make it part of your rhythm"
- **Error:** Drifting toward middle of waterway
  - **Correction:** "Stay close to starboard shore (safely)"

## Integration Drills

### Rhythm Rowing

**Purpose:** Develops consistent stroke rating and rhythm while maintaining technique.

**Execution:**
1. Row at a specified stroke rate (typically 16-20 SPM for beginners)
2. Coach may use verbal cadence or electronic rate monitor
3. Focus on maintaining technique while holding steady rate
4. Emphasize ratio of drive:recovery (typically 1:2 for beginners)
5. May use countdown format: "5 more at this rate..."

**Coaching Points:**
- Establish consistent recovery timing
- Control slide speed to maintain rate
- Avoid rushing recovery as pressure increases
- Maintain technical focus despite rate focus
- Use landmarks to check rhythm (e.g., 10 strokes between checks)

**Progression Options:**
- Begin with short pieces (30 seconds/1 minute)
- Progress to rate changes: "10 strokes at 18, 10 at 20"
- Add technical focus points while maintaining rhythm
- Progress to longer sustained pieces at consistent rate

**Common Errors and Corrections:**
- **Error:** Rushing recovery to maintain higher rate
  - **Correction:** "Quick hands, patient slide"
- **Error:** Stroke length shortening to keep up with rate
  - **Correction:** "Full compression, full extension, same rate"
- **Error:** Technical deterioration at higher rates
  - **Correction:** "Only row as fast as you can row well"

### Look-Row-Look Coordination

**Purpose:** Develops the critical skill of checking direction while maintaining rowing technique.

**Execution:**
1. Establish a structured looking pattern:
   - Look over right shoulder every 5 strokes
   - Look over left shoulder every 5 strokes
   - Alternate sides
2. Look during the drive phase for stability
3. Make looking part of the stroke rhythm
4. Progress to making small course corrections based on looking

**Coaching Points:**
- Keep rowing while looking (don't stop)
- Brief, focused glances rather than long looks
- Turn from the neck, not the entire torso
- Maintain stroke technique despite distraction of looking
- Look far ahead, not just immediately behind

**Progression Options:**
- Begin with scheduled looks (every X strokes)
- Progress to looking during specific stroke phase
- Add course correction based on observation
- Add obstacle identification challenges

**Common Errors and Corrections:**
- **Error:** Stopping rowing to look
  - **Correction:** "Quick glance during the drive, keep rowing"

   - 10 strokes at 50% pressure
   - 10 strokes at 60% pressure
   - 10 strokes at 70% pressure
   - 10 strokes at 80% pressure
   - Then back down the ladder
2. Focus on maintaining technique as pressure changes
3. Emphasis on consistent blade depth regardless of pressure
4. Maintain ratio and rhythm at all pressure levels

**Coaching Points:**
- Pressure comes from legs, not upper body
- Blade depth should remain consistent
- Body sequence remains the same at all pressures
- Watch for technique degradation at higher pressures
- Focus on clean catches and finishes at all levels

**Progression Options:**
- Begin with small range (e.g., 40-60%)
- Progress to wider range (30-80%)
- Add technical focus point at each pressure level
- Combine with rate changes for advanced challenge

**Common Errors and Corrections:**
- **Error:** Pulling with back/arms to increase pressure
  - **Correction:** "Pressure increase comes from leg drive"
- **Error:** Blade depth increasing with pressure
  - **Correction:** "Same depth, more horizontal force"
- **Error:** Rushing at higher pressures
