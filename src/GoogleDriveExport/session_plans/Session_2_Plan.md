| Erg Warm-up | 15 min | Reinforce sequencing, body position | Sequencing, Body Forward | "Focus on smooth transitions," "Pause and check posture" | Ensure proper setup |
| Equipment Prep | 20 min | Oars down first, boat sign-out, safe carrying to dock | N/A | "Remember oars first," "Sign out clearly" | Safe carrying techniques, clear pathways |
| Launching Procedure Review & Execution | 20 min | Review dock commands, safe launching steps, individual launching | N/A | "Bow points upstream," "Listen for 'Hands on'" | Maintain dock order, assist each other, coach supervision |
| On-Water Session 1 | 50 min | Coach Demo (Sequencing, Steering). Apply sequencing on water, basic turning | Sequencing, Relaxation | "Arms away, body over, then slide," "Gentle pressure to turn" | Stay within designated area, maintain safe distance |
| Mid-Session Break / Shore Talk | 10 min | Review progress, address common issues (balance, sequence), Q&A | N/A | "How does the sequence feel on water?" | Ensure hydration |
| On-Water Session 2 | 40 min | Coach Demo (Pause Drills). Introduce pause drills for control and body awareness | Sequencing, Body Forward | "Pause... check hands away," "Pause... feel body angle" | Maintain focus during pauses, be aware of drift/other boats |
| Landing Procedure & Practice | 15 min | Review dock approach (upstream), safe landing steps, individual practice | N/A | "Approach dock slowly, upstream," "Hands ready" | Communicate intentions, clear dock quickly |
| Post-Rowing Maintenance & Wrap-up | 10 min | Boat cleaning, storage, final Q&A | N/A | "Wipe down tracks," "Report any new issues" | Proper storage, secure straps |

> üí° **Tip:** The transition from ergometer to water is challenging for most beginners. Start with very small, controlled movements on the water. The Pick Drill on water is an excellent first activity as it builds gradually from arms-only rowing.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** Watch for signs of frustration when participants are adjusting to the unstable boat. Normalize the experience of wobbling and emphasize that balance develops with practice. Be ready to offer extra support to those who are particularly nervous.

## Detailed Drill Explanations

### Pick Drill (Water)
- **Execution:** Mirrors the erg drill but performed in the boat. Start with:
  1. Arms-only rowing from the finish (10 strokes)
  2. Progress to arms-and-body rowing (10 strokes)
  3. Add half-slide (10 strokes)
  4. Finally full-slide rowing (10 strokes)
- **Purpose:** Transfers the learned recovery sequence from stable erg to unstable boat, building confidence and control incrementally.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Focus on clean hand movement away from body first, then body pivot before knees bend. Emphasize patience and smooth transitions.

### Pause Drills (Arms Away, Body Over)
- **Execution:** Rowers execute stroke normally but insert a distinct pause (approx. 2 seconds) at specific points:
  - **Arms Away Pause:** Pause immediately after release, once hands have cleared knees
  - **Body Over Pause:** Pause after arms are extended and body has pivoted forward, before knees bend
- **Purpose:** Enhances body awareness and control during recovery. Explicitly teaches correct sequence, preventing common errors like early knee bend.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Use distinct verbal cadence: "Pull... Away... (pause)... Body... (pause)... Slide..." to help rowers internalize timing.

### Basic Turning (One Arm)
- **Execution:** While moving, rower takes gentle strokes with the oar on the *outside* of desired turn, while the oar on the *inside* of the turn trails in water or takes very light strokes.
- **Purpose:** Teaches fundamental boat control, allowing directional changes safely and effectively.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Keep movements gentle and controlled. Turning oar stroke length can be adjusted to control turning radius. Emphasize looking in the direction of turn.

## Common Beginner Errors & Corrective Cues

### Sequencing
- **Error:** Bending knees before hands are away/body is over.
  - **Cue:** "Hands away FIRST." "Body pivots, THEN knees bend." (Use Pause Drills)
- **Error:** Rushing the slide (moving too quickly towards the stern).
  - **Cue:** "Slow the slide, feel the boat glide." "Control the speed." (Use Pause Drills)

### Balance
- **Error:** Tensing up, high shoulders, gripping oars tightly.
  - **Cue:** "Relax shoulders down." "Breathe." "Light grip, let the oarlocks work."
- **Error:** Uneven hand heights causing boat tilt.
  - **Cue:** "Keep hands level on recovery." "Left hand slightly above right during crossover."

### Turning
- **Error:** Pulling too hard with turning oar, causing jerky movements.
  - **Cue:** "Gentle, steady pressure." "Look where you want to go."

### Blade Work
- **Error:** Catching crabs (oar gets stuck underwater).
  - **Cue:** "Focus on smooth sequence." "Square the blade just before entry." "Tap down cleanly at finish."

## Session 2 Coach Preparation

### Before the Session
- Arrive 30 minutes early
- Check weather and water conditions
