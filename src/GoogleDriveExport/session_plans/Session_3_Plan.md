## Session Schedule

| Activity | Time | Key Focus/Objective | Relevant Kraft's Key/BBS | Coaching Cues | Safety Notes |
|----------|------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Review Day 2 / Q&A | 10 min | Address questions, reinforce sequencing, introduce Day 3 focus (push, navigation) | N/A | "Today we focus on power from the legs and navigating safely." | N/A |
| Erg Warm-up | 15 min | Focus on leg drive initiation and connection | Application of pressure | "Push through heels," "Feel the hang," "Legs first, then back swing" | Proper setup |
| River Geography & Traffic Pattern Talk | 25 min | Use boathouse map, explain traffic pattern, steering, passing, turning areas, bridge rules | Steering | "Stay to the right," "Look every 3-5 strokes," "Pass wide and clear" | Emphasize constant awareness, rower responsibility for position |
| Equipment Prep & Launching | 20 min | Standard procedure | N/A | "Check equipment," "Sign out" | Dock safety |
| On-Water Session 1 | 50 min | Coach Demo (Good vs. Soft Push). Practice initiating drive with legs | Application of pressure | "Press the boat away," "Connect legs to handle," "No arm pull early" | Maintain spacing, listen for instructions, practice looking over shoulder |
| Mid-Session Break / Shore Talk | 10 min | Review leg drive feeling, Q&A on navigation rules | N/A | "Feel the difference when you push with legs?" | Hydration |
| On-Water Session 2 | 40 min | Continuous rowing focusing on leg drive application, practice pivot turns | Application of pressure | "Maintain leg pressure," "Back one oar, gentle pull other" | Check surroundings before turning, execute turns away from traffic/obstacles |
| Landing & Post-Rowing Maintenance | 10 min | Standard procedure | N/A | "Approach slow, bow upstream" | Dock safety |

> üí° **Tip:** When teaching leg drive, use simple analogies like "pushing a car" or "leg press machine" to help participants conceptualize the action. The feeling of connection between foot stretcher and handle is more important than generating maximum power at this stage.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** Many participants will struggle to look over their shoulders while maintaining rowing form. Make this a specific focus point in this session, as it's critical for safety. Consider dedicated drills where rowers take a few strokes, then pause to look around, gradually building to looking while rowing.

## Detailed Drill Explanations

### Reverse Pick Drill (Water)
- **Execution:** Start with:
  1. Legs-only strokes (maintaining forward body lean and straight arms) - 10 strokes
  2. Progress to legs-and-back swing - 10 strokes
  3. Then full strokes - 10 strokes
- **Purpose:** Isolates and emphasizes leg drive as the primary power source. Teaches rowers to connect effectively at catch and "hang" their body weight off handles.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Focus on pressure building from feet, maintaining connection through the drive, coordinating legs with back swing.

### Pivot Turns (One Backing/One Rowing)
- **Execution:** To execute a sharp turn (e.g., 180 degrees):
  1. Gently back water with one oar (pushing handle away, blade feathered or slightly squared)
  2. Take light, arms-only or arms-and-body forward strokes with the other oar
- **Purpose:** Essential skill for maneuvering in confined spaces, turning around buoys, approaching docks, or avoiding obstacles quickly.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Start with minimal pressure on both oars until feeling for the turn develops. Emphasize looking in the direction of the turn.

### Navigation Practice
- **Execution:** While rowing continuously:
  1. Coach designates points/landmarks to aim for
  2. Rowers practice looking over shoulder every 3-5 strokes
  3. Make small course corrections to maintain line
- **Purpose:** Develops awareness of position on river and builds habit of regular checking.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Emphasize quick glances rather than completely stopping rowing. Maintain technique while performing check.

## Common Beginner Errors & Corrective Cues

### Drive
- **Error:** Weak leg drive / Primarily pulling with arms.
  - **Cue:** "Push the foot stretchers away!" "Feel the pressure build from your feet." "Think 'legs' then 'swing' then 'pull.'" (Use Reverse Pick Drill)
- **Error:** Bum shoving (seat moves back before shoulders/handle).
  - **Cue:** "Connect the legs and back together." "Maintain forward body angle during initial leg push." "Think 'hang' off the handle."
- **Error:** Opening the back too early in the drive.
  - **Cue:** "Legs are halfway down BEFORE you swing the back." (Use Reverse Pick Drill)

### Steering
- **Error:** Not looking over shoulder frequently enough.
  - **Cue:** "Look every 3-5 strokes ‚Äì check your point, check for traffic!" Reinforce *why*: safety and maintaining course.
- **Error:** Oversteering or weaving side-to-side.
  - **Cue:** "Make small, gentle corrections." "Pick a fixed point far ahead and aim for it."

### Traffic Pattern
- **Error:** Consistently rowing on the wrong (port) side of the river.
  - **Coach Intervention:** "Stop rowing! Check your position. Move to the starboard side NOW." Reinforce the pattern.
- **Error:** Cutting corners on turns, not following established pattern.
  - **Cue:** "Take wide turns." "Follow the shoreline curve (at a safe distance)."

## Session 3 Coach Preparation

### Before the Session
- Arrive 30 minutes early
- Check weather and water conditions
- Prepare launch with safety equipment
- Test communication equipment
- Review participant progress from Session 2
- Identify any participants who may need extra support with drive phase
- Prepare river traffic pattern diagrams or maps

### Materials to Bring
- Session plan printout
- Participant list with notes from previous sessions
- Megaphone or whistle
- First aid kit
- Local river map with traffic pattern marked
- Spare clothing in launch (in case of unplanned capsize)
- Water/hydration options for mid-session break

### Follow-Up Tasks
- Document individual progress for each participant
- Identify participants ready for bridge navigation in Session 4
- Record any equipment issues in logbook
- Prepare coaching team for potential group division in Session 4
