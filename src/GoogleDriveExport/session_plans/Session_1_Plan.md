| Wrap-up, Q&A, Maintenance Intro | 15 min | Review key points, answer questions, introduce boat cleaning/storage | N/A | "Any questions?" "Wipe down hull after rowing" | Reporting equipment issues in logbook |

> üí° **Tip:** Manage cognitive load during the first session by breaking information into manageable chunks. Start with the physical motion (ergometer), then introduce equipment terminology, followed by handling practice. This progression helps participants avoid feeling overwhelmed.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** Don't rush the flip test. Ensure each participant feels adequately prepared and supported. Watch for signs of anxiety and provide additional coaching for hesitant participants.

## Detailed Drill Explanations

### Erg - Pick Drill
- **Execution:** Starting from the finish position (legs flat, body leaned back slightly, arms drawn in), rowers practice:
  1. Arms away only (10 strokes)
  2. Arms and body pivot forward (10 strokes)
  3. Adding partial slide segments (10 strokes)
  4. Building towards the full stroke (10 strokes)
- **Purpose:** Teaches the correct sequence of movements for the recovery (arms, body, slide), emphasizing a clean release, proper hand levels, and good posture before the slide begins.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Watch for rushing forward with the body, dropping hands, hunching shoulders. Emphasize "hands lead body, body leads slide."

### Erg - Reverse Pick Drill
- **Execution:** Starting at the catch position (shins vertical, body forward, arms extended), rowers practice:
  1. Legs only drive (10 strokes)
  2. Legs and back swing (10 strokes)
  3. Full stroke adding arm draw (10 strokes)
- **Purpose:** Establishes fundamental concept of initiating drive with powerful leg muscles, preventing premature back swing or arm pulling.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Focus on hang/connection at catch, maintaining body angle during initial drive, coordinating leg finish with back swing.

### Dockside - Ghost Strokes
- **Execution:** While sitting in boat at dock (with coach stabilizing), rower practices minimal, light strokes focusing on handle movement, feathering and squaring, without actual boat movement.
- **Purpose:** Builds initial confidence and oar control understanding in a safe, controlled environment.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Focus on light grip, relaxed shoulders, horizontal hands, and blade control. Coach should be prepared to stabilize boat if needed.

## Common Beginner Errors & Corrective Cues

### Erg
- **Error:** Gripping handles too tightly.
  - **Cue:** "Relax fingers, think 'hooks,' not fists." "Imagine holding a baby bird ‚Äì firm but gentle."
- **Error:** Breaking arms early during the drive.
  - **Cue:** "Legs push first, keep arms straight like ropes." (Use Reverse Pick Drill)
- **Error:** Slouching posture (rounded back).
  - **Cue:** "Sit tall from the hips, core engaged, proud chest."

### Boat Handling
- **Error:** Incorrect carry grip (hands on hull).
  - **Cue:** "Hands on gunwales or carry on shoulders for singles."
- **Error:** Bumping riggers against racks/other boats.
  - **Cue:** "Watch your riggers! Communicate with partner."

### Getting In/Out
- **Error:** Rushing, standing up too quickly, losing balance.
  - **Cue:** "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast." "Keep weight low and centered." "One hand on dock, one on boat."

### Flip Test
- **Error:** Panicking in water.
  - **Cue:** "Breathe. Stay calm. The boat and oars float. Hold onto the boat."
- **Error:** Difficulty re-entering (pulling boat over).
  - **Cue:** "Keep body low in water." "Use strong leg kick." "Pull across, not down." (Coach provides physical guidance)

## Session 1 Coach Preparation

### Before the Session
