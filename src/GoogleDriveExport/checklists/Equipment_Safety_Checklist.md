# Equipment Safety Checklist

Safety in rowing begins with properly functioning equipment. This checklist provides a comprehensive guide for inspecting boats and equipment before each row. Coach should demonstrate these checks during the first session and reinforce them throughout the program.

## Quick Reference: Critical Safety Components

| Component | Safety Function | What to Check |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Bow Ball** | Protects against impact injuries | Securely attached, minimum 4cm diameter |
| **Heel Restraints** | Allows quick foot release during capsize | Functional, limited heel lift, quick release |
| **Hull Integrity** | Prevents water intake, ensures buoyancy | No cracks or damage |
| **Rigger Attachment** | Prevents equipment failure | All bolts tight, no movement |
| **Oarlock Gates** | Secures oars during rowing | Close properly, secure |
| **Oar Collars/Buttons** | Maintains proper leverage | Securely fastened, correctly positioned |
| **PFDs** (when used) | Provides flotation | Properly fitted, functional |

- [ ] **Backstay** (if present) is secure
- [ ] **Splash Guards** (if present) are secure
- [ ] **Electronics** (if present) are secured and waterproofed
- [ ] **Vents/Hatches** are closed and sealed

## Oar Safety Check

- [ ] **Collars/Buttons** are:
  - Securely fastened
  - Correctly positioned
  - Not worn or damaged
- [ ] **Shafts** show no:
  - Cracks or splinters
  - Significant wear spots
  - Abnormal flexibility
- [ ] **Blades** have:
  - No delamination
  - No edge damage
  - Intact surface
- [ ] **Handles** are:
  - Clean and free of sticky residue
  - Not worn through to carbon/wood
  - Free of tape residue (if previously taped)
- [ ] **Sleeves** (where collar sits) are not excessively worn

## Launch Safety Equipment Checklist

For coaching launches accompanying rowing sessions:

- [ ] **PFDs** for all launch occupants plus extras
- [ ] **Working engine** with adequate fuel
- [ ] **Paddle/oar** for manual propulsion if needed
- [ ] **Throw bag/rope** for rescue situations
- [ ] **Bailer/pump** for removing water
- [ ] **Basic tool kit** for quick equipment repairs
- [ ] **First aid kit**
- [ ] **Whistle/horn** for signaling
- [ ] **Communication device** (phone/radio in waterproof case)
- [ ] **Appropriate lighting** if low light conditions possible

## Coach Safety Equipment
Each coach should have ready access to:

- [ ] **PFD** appropriate to conditions
- [ ] **Whistle** for signaling
- [ ] **Communication device** (phone/radio in waterproof case)
- [ ] **Basic first aid supplies**
- [ ] **Appropriate clothing** for conditions (including spare)

## How to Perform Equipment Checks

### Bow Ball Check
1. Visually inspect for presence and attachment
2. Gently push/pull to verify secure attachment
3. Ensure diameter is at least 4cm (size of a tennis ball)

### Heel Restraint Check
1. Sit in boat or position foot on stretcher
2. Attempt to lift heel - should have limited movement but release from footplate
3. Verify release would be possible in capsize situation

### Rigger and Oarlock Check
1. Visually inspect for alignment and damage
2. Grasp rigger and attempt to move - should have no movement
3. Open and close gates to verify function
4. Check for loose or missing hardware

### Hull Integrity Check
1. Visually inspect exterior for cracks, holes, or damage
2. Check for water inside hull
3. Pay special attention to seams and attachment points

## When to Report Equipment Issues

Report equipment issues immediately when you discover:
- Any safety-critical component is damaged or non-functional
- Equipment damage that affects performance or usability
- Water in the hull from leaks
- Loose or missing hardware
- Excessive wear on any component

## How to Report Equipment Issues

1. **Inform coach or boathouse manager immediately**
2. **Record in equipment logbook:**
   - Boat/equipment name/number
   - Date and time
   - Specific issue described clearly
   - Your name and contact information
3. **Tag equipment as unusable** if issue affects safety
4. **Follow up** if issue isn't addressed promptly

## Adjustment Guidelines

### Foot Stretcher Adjustment
Proper foot stretcher adjustment is crucial for both comfort and safety:

1. **Height:** Positioned so that at the finish, the oar handle crosses the body at lower rib height
2. **Distance:** Set so that at the catch, the shins are roughly vertical
3. **Angle:** Typically 42-45 degrees from horizontal

**To adjust:**
1. Loosen mounting bolts/clamps (typically inside hull)
2. Slide stretcher to desired position
3. Ensure both sides are equal distance from fixed point
4. Retighten securely
5. Always check heel restraints after adjusting

### Oarlock Height
Proper oarlock height ensures efficient rowing and reduces injury risk:

1. **Standard position:** Oarlock height set so hands cross over comfortably at body with minimal vertical movement
2. **Adjusting:** Requires proper tools and should be done under supervision for beginners
3. **After adjustment:** Always check that all bolts are retightened

## Equipment-Related Emergency Procedures

### Damaged Equipment During Row
If equipment becomes damaged during a row:
1. Stop rowing immediately
2. Assess if continued rowing is safe
3. Signal to coach if assistance needed
4. Return to dock using appropriate modified technique
5. Report issue immediately upon return

### Capsize Due to Equipment Failure
If capsize occurs due to equipment failure:
1. Follow standard capsize recovery procedures
2. Identify and secure loose equipment if possible
3. Return to dock with caution
4. Document exact nature of failure
5. Remove equipment from service until repaired

Remember: Equipment checks take only a few minutes but can prevent unsafe situations on the water. Make them a standard part of your pre-row routine.
