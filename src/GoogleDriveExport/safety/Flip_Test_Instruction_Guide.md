# Flip Test Instruction Guide

This comprehensive guide provides detailed instructions for teaching and assessing the capsize recovery drill ("flip test"), a critical safety skill for all scullers. Use this resource to prepare, execute, and evaluate flip tests effectively and safely.

## Purpose and Importance

The flip test is an intentional, supervised capsize and recovery drill typically conducted during the first session of the Learn to Scull program. It serves several crucial purposes:

- **Safety Preparation**: Demonstrates that rowers can self-rescue if they capsize during rowing
- **Confidence Building**: Reduces anxiety about capsizing by providing practical experience
- **Skill Development**: Teaches essential recovery techniques in a controlled environment
- **Fear Management**: Demystifies the capsizing experience and builds water comfort
- **Assessment**: Allows coaches to evaluate a rower's ability to handle emergency situations

A successful flip test is generally considered a prerequisite for independent sculling. The skills learned apply to real capsize scenarios that any sculler might encounter, regardless of experience level.

## Preparation Requirements

### Location Selection
- Protected area close to dock
- Water depth: deep enough to prevent ground contact but not excessively deep
- Minimal current or boat traffic
- Good visibility for supervision
- Preferably warm water conditions when possible

### Equipment Needs
- Sculling boat (preferably a stable training single)
- Oars (standard sculling oars)
- Personal flotation devices (available but not necessarily worn)
- Warm towels for after test
- Change of clothes for participants
- First aid kit readily available
- Coach's launch nearby for assistance if needed
- Whistle/megaphone for communication

### Coach Preparation
- Coach in water or very close to participant
- Second coach monitoring other participants
- Clear verbal commands prepared
- Familiarity with different re-entry techniques
- Awareness of participant's swimming ability and comfort
- Knowledge of physical limitations of participants
- Prepared to demonstrate technique first if appropriate

### Participant Preparation
- Mental preparation and explanation of procedures
- Understanding of the purpose and importance
- Appropriate clothing (avoid loose/heavy garments)
- Removal of watches, jewelry, glasses (secured with strap if needed)
- Acknowledgment of any relevant medical conditions
- Confirmation of swimming ability

## Step-by-Step Instruction Protocol

### 1. Introduction and Demonstration

**Land-Based Explanation:**
1. Explain the purpose of the flip test
2. Outline the sequence of events that will occur
3. Emphasize "stay with the boat" as the primary safety rule
4. Describe the T-position of oars for stability
5. Explain re-entry technique, focusing on the leg kick
6. Address common concerns and emphasize coach support

**Optional Coach Demonstration:**
1. Coach may demonstrate the complete sequence first
2. Alternatively, use video demonstration prior to session
3. Emphasize calmness and methodical approach throughout

### 2. Initial Set-Up

**Boat Positioning:**
1. Position boat parallel to dock
2. Distance from dock: close enough for safety, far enough for maneuverability
3. Coach positioned in water between boat and dock
4. Ensure oars are properly secured in oarlocks
5. Verify all participants are attentive and can observe

**Participant Positioning:**
1. Participant enters boat normally at dock
2. Adjusts foot stretchers appropriately
3. Takes proper grip on oars
4. Establishes balance in the boat
5. Receives final instructions before controlled capsize

### 3. Controlled Capsize Execution

**Capsize Procedure:**
1. Coach announces "Ready to begin flip test"
2. Participant acknowledges readiness
3. Coach instructs: "On my count, lean slowly to your [right/left] until boat capsizes"
4. Coach counts: "1, 2, 3, lean"
5. Participant leans gradually until boat flips
6. Coach ensures controlled entry into water

**Immediate Post-Capsize:**
1. Coach verifies participant's comfort level
2. Reminds: "Stay calm, hold onto the boat"
3. Instructs: "Take inventory of yourself and equipment"
4. Ensures both oars are secured (attached to riggers)
5. Guides participant to stern/middle position for re-entry

### 4. Boat Righting (If Necessary)

**If Boat is Upside Down:**
1. Coach instructs: "Swim to the side of the boat"
2. "Reach across the hull to the far gunwale" 
3. "Pull the boat towards you to roll it upright"
4. "Be careful of riggers as the boat rolls over"
5. "Position yourself at the middle of the boat once upright"

**Common Challenges:**
1. Difficulty reaching across hull (alternative: push down on near gunwale)
2. Boat rolling too quickly (caution participant about riggers)
3. Oars tangled (coach assists with freeing oars)

### 5. Oar Positioning for Stability

**T-Position Setup:**
1. Coach instructs: "Position both oars perpendicular to the boat"
2. "Arrange the oars in a 'T' shape with the boat"
3. "Make sure blades are flat (feathered) on the water surface"
4. "Overlap the handles near the cockpit for added stability"
5. "Feel how this position stabilizes the boat"

**Verification:**
1. Coach checks oar position
2. Ensures blades are properly feathered on water
3. Verifies handles are accessible to participant
4. Makes adjustments if necessary
5. Confirms boat stability before proceeding

### 6. Re-Entry Technique (Side Entry Method)

**Position for Re-entry:**
1. Coach instructs: "Position yourself at the center of the boat"
2. "Face the boat with your chest toward the side"
3. "Grasp the overlapped oar handles with your hand closer to the stern"
4. "Place your other hand on the boat near the center"
5. "Prepare for the kick and hip movement"

**The Kick & Hip Lift (Key Movement):**
1. Coach explains: "This is the crucial movement - focus on leg power"
2. "Take a breath and let yourself sink slightly in the water"
3. "Execute a powerful kick (dolphin or scissor) straight up"
4. "Simultaneously, push down on the oar handles/boat with your hands"
5. "Drive your hips up and onto the gunwale or deck"

**The Roll-In:**
1. Once participant's hips/stomach are across gunwale, coach instructs:
2. "Pause briefly to balance, trust the stability from the T-positioned oars"
3. "Roll your body towards the cockpit"
4. "Swing the leg farthest from the boat OVER the hull and into the cockpit"
5. "Bring the other leg in and carefully shift weight to sit on the seat"

**Regaining Control:**
1. "Immediately take control of the oar handles"
2. "Lift handles slightly to keep blades flat on water for stability"
3. "Take a moment to breathe and situate yourself completely on the seat"
4. "Be aware that the boat will have some water in it - this is normal"
5. "Prepare to row gently back to the dock"

### 7. Alternative Re-Entry Techniques

**For Participants Struggling with Side Entry:**

**Stern Entry Method:**
1. Swim to the stern of the boat
2. Position oars in T-position for stability
3. Hold both gunwales at stern
4. Kick legs up to the surface
5. Pull torso onto the stern deck
6. Straddle the boat and slide forward to the seat

**Coach-Assisted Method:**
1. Coach positions on opposite side of boat
2. Stabilizes boat during participant's re-entry attempt
3. Provides additional support under participant's shoulder/arm if needed
4. Guides participant through kick and roll technique
5. Gradually reduces assistance as participant progresses

**PFD-Assisted Method:**
1. For very anxious participants or those struggling repeatedly
2. Participant wears PFD for additional buoyancy
3. Follow standard side entry technique
4. Focus on technique rather than strength
5. May require additional practice sessions

### 8. Return to Dock

**After Successful Re-Entry:**
1. Coach instructs: "Gently row back to dock"
2. "Focus on stability - not speed"
3. "Use light, controlled strokes"
4. "Keep looking around for awareness"
5. "Exit boat normally at dock"

**Post-Test Care:**
1. Assist participant from water as needed
2. Provide towel and encourage changing to dry clothes
3. Check for any physical concerns
4. Drain water from boat as necessary
5. Record completion of flip test in participant records

## Assessment Criteria

### Success Indicators
For a participant to be considered to have successfully completed the flip test, they should demonstrate:

1. **Calmness During Capsize:**
   - Maintained composure during planned capsize
   - Followed instructions methodically
   - Showed no signs of panic or distress

2. **Boat Management:**
   - Stayed with the boat throughout the process
   - Successfully righted the boat if necessary
   - Positioned oars effectively for stability

3. **Re-Entry Execution:**
   - Executed the kick and hip lift with sufficient power
   - Maintained boat stability during re-entry
   - Successfully returned to seated position in boat
   - Regained control of oars after re-entry

4. **Return to Dock:**
   - Able to row safely back to dock
   - Maintained reasonable stability while rowing
   - Exited boat appropriately

### Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Possible Causes | Solutions |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Difficulty getting hips onto gunwale** | Insufficient leg kick, poor coordination, upper body weakness | Focus on stronger leg drive, practice timing, try from different position |
| **Boat rolling away during re-entry** | Improper oar T-position, uneven weight distribution | Verify oar position, coach stabilize temporarily, adjust approach angle |
| **Unable to roll into boat once hips up** | Lack of core strength, boat instability, fear of rolling | Break movement into smaller parts, coach physical guidance, practice on land |
| **Excessive anxiety or panic** | Fear of water, previous negative experiences, concern about failure | Slow down process, more land practice, provide additional assurance and support |
| **Boat taking on excessive water** | Prolonged capsize time, splash during re-entry | Drain boat partially before re-entry, practice quicker execution |

## Special Considerations

### Weather Factors
- **Cold Water:** Reduce time in water, have warm drinks/clothing available, consider shortened version
- **Wind:** Position boat to minimize drift, consider postponing in high winds
- **Rain:** Ensure good visibility, be aware of slippery surfaces
- **Heat:** Provide shade and hydration, be aware of exhaustion signs

### Physical Limitations
- **Limited Upper Body Strength:** Focus more on leg power, consider assisted method
- **Limited Flexibility:** Adapt entry technique for individual needs
- **Previous Injuries:** Discuss modifications based on specific limitations
- **Anxiety/Trauma:** Allow extra time for mental preparation, consider gradual exposure

### Adaptive Approaches
- **Visual Impairments:** Provide additional verbal cueing and physical guidance
- **Hearing Impairments:** Establish clear visual signals and physical cues
- **Mobility Limitations:** Adapt technique to emphasize available strengths
- **Cognitive Challenges:** Break process into smaller steps, provide frequent reinforcement

## Post-Test Procedures

### Documentation
- Record completion status for each participant
- Note any modifications or special considerations
- Document any challenges encountered
- Identify areas for continued development
- Include in participant's permanent record

### Feedback and Reflection
- Provide immediate positive reinforcement
- Discuss what went well and areas for improvement
- Encourage participant self-reflection
- Answer questions about real-world application
- Connect experience to ongoing safety practices

### Follow-Up
- For successful completions: reinforce confidence and readiness
- For partial completions: schedule additional practice
- For unsuccessful attempts: provide encouragement and alternative development plan
- Consider periodic re-testing for all scullers (annually recommended)
