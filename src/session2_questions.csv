"S2Q1","What is the primary focus of Session 2: Hitting the Water?","Mastering the flip test","Developing maximum power on the ergometer","Transferring the erg stroke sequence to the boat and basic control","Advanced race strategy","2","Session 2 focuses on applying the learned stroke sequence from the erg to the water, emphasizing recovery sequence and basic boat handling."
"S2Q2","What is the correct recovery sequence emphasized in Session 2?","Slide -> Body -> Arms","Arms -> Slide -> Body","Body -> Arms -> Slide","Arms -> Body -> Slide","3","The correct recovery sequence is Arms away, then Body pivot forward, then Legs compress (Slide)."
"S2Q3","What drill is specifically mentioned in Session 2 for transferring the recovery sequence from the erg to the water incrementally?","Reverse Pick Drill","Pause Drills","Pick Drill (Water)","Continuous Rowing","2","The Pick Drill on water (starting arms-only, then adding body, then slide) is used to transfer the sequence gradually."
"S2Q4","What is the purpose of Pause Drills (e.g., Arms Away Pause, Body Over Pause) introduced in Session 2?","To increase rowing speed","To enhance body awareness and control during recovery","To practice emergency stops","To improve leg drive power","1","Pause drills help rowers internalize the correct timing and sequence of the recovery phase."
"S2Q5","What common sequencing error do Pause Drills help prevent?","Pulling too hard with the arms","Bending knees before the hands are away or body is over","Leaning back too far at the finish","Not rotating the body enough","1","Pause drills explicitly reinforce getting the hands away and body pivoted before the knees bend."
"S2Q6","When launching a boat from the dock, which way should the bow typically point?","Downstream","Directly across the river","Upstream","Towards the boathouse","2","The standard procedure mentioned involves pointing the bow upstream when launching."
"S2Q7","What action should you prioritize first when preparing equipment for launching according to Session 2?","Get the boat down","Sign out the boat","Put oars down near the dock","Adjust foot stretchers","2","Session 2 mentions 'Oars down first' as part of the equipment prep routine."
"S2Q8","What is a common cause of poor balance mentioned in Session 2, often correctable by a simple cue?","Sitting too high","Uneven hand heights during recovery","Using oars that are too long","Not enough leg drive","1","Uneven hand heights are cited as a common cause of boat tilt. The cue is 'Keep hands level'."
"S2Q9","What is the recommended technique for basic turning discussed in Session 2?","Using the rudder","Leaning the body heavily","Taking gentle strokes with the outside oar while trailing the inside oar","Backing water firmly with both oars","2","Basic turning is taught by taking gentle strokes with the oar on the outside of the turn."
"S2Q10","What does 'catching a crab' mean in rowing, as mentioned in Session 2's common errors?","Hitting a submerged object","The oar getting stuck underwater during the stroke","Losing grip of the oar handle","Catching the boat ahead","1","Catching a crab refers to the oar blade getting stuck underwater, often disrupting the stroke."
"S2Q11","Why is it important to relax, keep shoulders down, and use a light grip, especially when first learning on the water?","It looks more professional","It helps maintain balance in the unstable boat","It allows for a faster stroke rate","It prevents blisters","1","Tensing up, high shoulders, and tight grips negatively affect balance in a sculling shell."
"S2Q12","When landing the boat, how should you generally approach the dock?","Quickly and downstream","Slowly and downstream","Quickly and upstream","Slowly and upstream","3","The plan states to 'Approach dock slowly, upstream'."
"S2Q13","What post-rowing task is emphasized at the end of Session 2?","Reviewing video footage","Completing a written test","Boat cleaning and proper storage","Planning the next workout","2","Boat cleaning (e.g., wiping down tracks) and storage are key post-rowing maintenance tasks."
"S2Q14","What is the primary purpose of using the Pick Drill on the water in Session 2?","To practice steering in tight spaces","To incrementally transfer erg stroke sequence and control to the boat","To build maximum leg power","To practice capsize recovery drills","1","The Pick Drill on water breaks down the stroke (arms only -> arms/body -> slide) to help safely transfer the coordinated sequence learned on the ergometer to the less stable environment of the boat."
"S2Q15","During launching, pointing the bow upstream primarily helps with...?","Seeing downstream traffic more easily","Making the boat easier to clean","Managing river current for a more controlled departure from the dock","Impressing the coach with proper procedure","2","Pointing the bow upstream when launching allows the current to naturally help move the stern away from the dock, making departure easier and more controlled, especially for beginners."
