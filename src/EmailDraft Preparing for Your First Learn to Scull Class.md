**Subject: Great First Day on the Water\! Here's What's Next**

Dear Students,

Congratulations on completing your first day of the Learn to Scull class\! It was fantastic to see everyoneâ€™s enthusiasm and progress. Here's a quick summary of what we covered today and what you can look forward to in the next session.

**Day 1 Recap:**

1. **Introductions:**  
   * We got to know each other and shared our reasons for joining the class.  
2. **Basic Rowing Motions:**  
   * On the erg (rowing machine), we practiced the basic rowing stroke, focusing on sequencing and the correct grip.  
   * Key points included keeping the body forward, staying relaxed, and ensuring all movements were horizontal.  
3. **Equipment Overview:**  
   * We discussed the different parts of the boat and oars, including how to carry and handle them safely.  
4. **Flip Test:**  
   * Everyone had a chance to practice the flip test, learning how to recover from a capsize.

**Preparing for Day 2:**

1. **Basic Stroke Sequencing:**  
   * We will reinforce body position and sequencing from Day 1 with a 15-minute erg warm-up.  
   * We will practice carrying the boats to the dock and launching them.  
2. **Turning and Steering:**  
   * You will learn basic turning techniques, such as rowing with one arm at a time to achieve 90-degree turns.  
   * We'll demonstrate and practice the sequence of arms-only, arms and body, and full slide strokes.

**Reminders:**

* Please arrive a few minutes early to get settled.  
* Bring your refillable water bottle, sunscreen, hat, and a towel.  
* Dress appropriately for the weather, with layers if it's cold and water-resistant shoes.  
* Make sure to sign in and out on the logbook for each session.

We look forward to seeing you for Day 2, where we will build on the foundations we set today and get more comfortable on the water. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reply to this email.
