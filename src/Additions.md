Post Rowing Maintenance:

1. Cleaning the Boat  
   Before putting the boat back on its rack, place it on the stretchers/slings and thoroughly wipe it down using a rag/towel provided by the club. This ensures the equipment is clean and ready for the next use.  
2. Storing the Boat  
   After cleaning, place the boat back in its original rack position. Ensure the riggers align with those of other boats on the rack to maintain uniformity and balance. Make sure it is properly supported to prevent damage.  
3. Oar Handles  
   Routinely disinfect oar handles after each row. This is crucial for maintaining hygiene and preventing the spread of germs, especially given the likelihood of blisters and potential bleeding. Additionally, it removes residues from bandages or tapes some rowers might use.  
4. Reporting Issues  
   Please note any issues with the equipment in the logbook.
