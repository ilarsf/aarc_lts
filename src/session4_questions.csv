"S4Q1","What is the main overall goal of Session 4: Navigation and Working Up River?","Learning basic rowing terms","Mastering the ergometer technique","Integrating all previously learned skills for independent sculling","Winning a practice race","2","Session 4 focuses on putting all skills together, river navigation including bridges, and achieving independent sculling capability."
"S4Q2","Why might the group be divided in Session 4 (e.g., Bridge Ready vs. Skills Development)?","To separate friends who talk too much","To allow coaches to focus on specific needs based on rower assessment","To practice rowing in different types of boats","To have a race between groups","1","Group division allows coaches to provide targeted instruction, such as bridge practice for confident navigators and skill refinement for others."
"S4Q3","What is a key safety rule when navigating through bridge arches, as emphasized in Session 4?","Speed up significantly","Pass other boats only if necessary","Maintain course through a designated arch and do not pass other boats within the arch","Stop rowing completely under the bridge","2","The bridge pattern involves using specific arches and strictly prohibits passing within the arches for safety."
"S4Q4","What does 'Continuous Rowing with Navigation Focus' primarily aim to develop?","Maximum power output","Perfect blade work","The ability to row effectively while actively steering and monitoring surroundings","The fastest possible stroke rate","2","This activity integrates rowing technique with the constant demands of safe navigation and awareness."
"S4Q5","What common error occurs when rowers focus too much on navigation or steering?","Rowing too slowly","Technique deterioration","Forgetting to breathe","Gripping the oars too lightly","1","Beginners often let their rowing technique suffer when they have to multitask with steering and looking around."
"S4Q6","For the group focusing on bridge passage, what is a key coaching cue when approaching the arch?","'Close your eyes and pull hard'","'Aim for the center of the arch, eyes up, commit to your line'","'Stop rowing and drift through'","'Follow the boat ahead very closely'","1","Coaching focuses on aiming for the center, looking up for clearance, and maintaining a steady course through the arch."
"S4Q7","If a rower consistently fails to stay on the correct (starboard) side of the river, especially around bends, what is the recommended coach action?","Ignore it, they will learn eventually","Discuss it after the row","Use whistle or megaphone to redirect immediately","Ask them to stop and wait","2","Maintaining the traffic pattern is crucial for safety, requiring immediate correction if a rower strays."
"S4Q8","What skill refinement drill might be used in Session 4 for rowers struggling with the recovery sequence?","Legs-only rowing","Pause drills","High-rate pieces","Square blade rowing","1","Pause drills are specifically mentioned as a way to reinforce sequencing for the skills development group."
"S4Q9","What is the purpose of the Rower Assessment conducted during or after Session 4?","To rank rowers from best to worst","To determine eligibility for elite programs","To evaluate individual skill competency and provide feedback for next steps","To assign cleaning duties","2","The assessment checks if rowers have achieved the necessary skills for safe independent or supervised rowing and informs recommendations."
"S4Q10","What common navigation error involves looking only at the boat directly ahead?","Following too closely","Fixating, rather than scanning and picking independent points","Cutting corners","Rowing too straight","1","Rowers need to look beyond the boat in front to anticipate bends, traffic, and choose their own steering points."
"S4Q11","What does 'independent sculling capability' imply by the end of Session 4?","The rower needs no further coaching","The rower can race competitively","The rower can safely navigate and handle the boat without constant direct supervision","The rower can perform the flip test unassisted","2","The goal is for the rower to demonstrate sufficient skill and awareness to row safely on their own or in less supervised groups."
"S4Q12","What should a rower do if their technique starts to break down while they are focusing on steering?","Stop rowing completely","Ignore the technique and focus only on steering","Try to integrate steering into the rhythm, perhaps focusing on 'one thought at a time'","Ask the coach to steer for them","2","The goal is integration. Cues like 'Find a rhythm' or 'One thought at a time' help manage the cognitive load."
"S4Q13","What information is typically provided to participants at the end of Session 4?","A detailed report card","Assigned workout plans for the next month","Information about pathways after the program (e.g., joining club sessions)","A free water bottle","2","The final wrap-up includes discussing options for continuing to row after completing the Learn-to-Scull program."
"S4Q14","For the Skills Development group in Session 4, what type of drill might be used to reinforce correct recovery sequencing?","High-intensity race pieces","Legs-only rowing","Pause drills (e.g., arms away, body over)","Steering obstacle course","2","Session 4 plan mentions that the Skills Development group might work on consistency using drills. Pause drills are specifically designed to reinforce correct sequencing during the recovery phase."
