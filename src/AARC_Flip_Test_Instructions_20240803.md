# **Flip Test Instructions**

## **Objective: Learn how to recover from a capsize and re-enter the scull safely.**

### **Capsize:**

1. Purposefully flip the boat to understand the sensation and practice recovery.  
2. Remain calm and orient yourself in the water.

### **Right the Boat (if completely turned over):**

1. Approach the overturned scull from the side.  
2. Reach across the hull (bottom) of the boat to the far side and grab the gunwale (the top edge of the boat).  
3. Slowly pull the boat towards you to right it. Watch out for the oars as the boat flips back over.

### **Position the Oars:**

1. Arrange the near side oar perpendicular to the boat with the blade flat on the water.  
2. Do the same with the far side oar. If the second oar is not cooperating, swim around the boat (or dive under it, but watch out for the rigger) to sort it out to avoid losing it or struggling to grab it.  
3. Ensure both oars are feathered (blades flat).

### **Re-entering the Boat:**

1. Overlap the two oar handles and grasp them with the hand closest to the stern.  
2. Place your other hand on the center strip.  
3. Boost yourself out of the water by pushing down on the oar handles and the center strip.  
4. Use a strong scissor kick to lift your hips onto the boat.  
5. Twist your hips and sit down.  
6. Immediately lift the hand holding the oar handles and get the blades flat on the water for stability. If the blades are underwater, wait for them to float to the surface.  
7. Get your butt back on the seat.  
   * Sometimes it helps to put your legs out the sides and lean forward to lift your butt, then pull the seat under you and bring your legs back into the boat.

### **Post-Recovery:**

1. Once back in the boat, take a moment to stabilize and regain balance.  
2. Ensure the oars are properly positioned and that you are seated correctly.  
3. Signal to the coach or support boat that you are ready to continue.

## **Additional Tips**

* If re-entry is difficult, swim towards the shore to a shallow area where you can stand. This can make re-entry easier, though the riverbed may be muddy and soft.  
* Practice makes perfect: the more you practice the flip test, the more comfortable you will become with the recovery process.  
* Stay calm and collected: panic can make the recovery process more difficult.  
* Use controlled movements to avoid tipping the boat again.
