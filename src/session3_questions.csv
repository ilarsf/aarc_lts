S3Q1,"What is the main technical focus of Session 3: Learning How to Push?","Improving recovery sequence","Developing effective leg drive and power application","Mastering feathering technique","Advanced steering maneuvers",1,"Session 3 focuses on developing the power phase, specifically initiating the drive with the legs."
S3Q2,"Which drill is used on the water in Session 3 to specifically emphasize initiating the drive with the legs?","Pick Drill","Pause Drills","Reverse Pick Drill","Square Blade Rowing",2,"The Reverse Pick Drill (starting legs-only, then adding back, then arms) isolates and emphasizes the leg drive."
S3Q3,"What common error involves the seat moving backward before the shoulders and handle at the start of the drive?","Opening the back too early","Skying the blades","Weak leg drive","Bum shoving",3,"Bum shoving is when the seat shoots back without the body/shoulders moving with it, indicating poor connection."
S3Q4,"What is the recommended frequency for looking over your shoulder to check your course and surroundings?","Once per minute","Every 10-15 strokes","Only when turning","Every 3-5 strokes",3,"Session 3 emphasizes looking around every 3-5 strokes for safety and navigation."
S3Q5,"According to standard river traffic patterns discussed in Session 3, which side of the river should you generally stay on?","The left (Port) side","The middle of the river","The right (Starboard) side","Whichever side has less wind",2,"The standard traffic pattern requires staying to the starboard (right) side relative to your direction of travel."
S3Q6,"What technique is taught in Session 3 for executing sharp turns or turning in confined spaces?","Wide, sweeping turns using one oar","Using body lean only","Pivot Turns (one oar backing, one rowing forward)","Dragging one oar",2,"Pivot turns, involving backing one oar and rowing forward with the other, are taught for tight maneuvering."
S3Q7,"What does the term 'connection' refer to in the context of the leg drive?","Connecting with your crewmates emotionally","The feeling of pressure linking the foot stretcher, legs, back, and handle","Connecting the boat to the dock","Connecting the oars properly in the oarlocks",1,"Connection refers to effectively linking the push from the legs through the body to the oar handles without slippage or sequencing errors."
S3Q8,"What is a corrective cue for someone opening their back too early during the drive?","'Pull harder with the arms'","'Legs are halfway down BEFORE you swing the back'","'Lean further forward at the catch'","'Relax your shoulders'",1,"The cue emphasizes completing more of the leg drive before initiating the back swing."
S3Q9,"During the navigation talk, what key aspect of rower responsibility is emphasized?","Reporting equipment issues","Ensuring the coach sees you","Maintaining awareness and responsibility for your position and course","Wiping down the boat thoroughly",2,"Session 3 highlights the rower's responsibility for knowing where they are, following traffic patterns, and looking around."
S3Q10,"What is the corrective cue for a rower who is primarily pulling with their arms instead of driving with their legs?","'Swing your back more'","'Push the foot stretchers away!'","'Keep your arms bent'","'Feather the blade earlier'",1,"This cue directly prompts the rower to initiate the drive with leg pressure."
S3Q11,"Why is looking frequently over your shoulder considered critical for safety?","To check your technique","To see if the coach is watching","To be aware of your position, potential hazards, and other boats","To rest your neck muscles",2,"Constant awareness of surroundings is essential for collision avoidance and safe navigation."
S3Q12,"When practicing navigation, what should rowers aim for to maintain a straight course?","Looking only at the boat ahead","Making large, infrequent corrections","Picking a fixed point far ahead and aiming for it","Following the waves",2,"Focusing on a distant point helps maintain a straighter course compared to only looking nearby."
S3Q13,"What does the 'hang' refer to, often mentioned in relation to the leg drive?","Hanging the oars on the rack","The feeling of suspending body weight off the handles at the catch, driven by leg pressure","Hanging back at the finish","Hanging onto the dock before launching",1,"'Hanging' off the handles implies using body weight effectively, connected to the leg drive at the beginning of the stroke."
