AARC Learn to Scull Class Overview  
Class runs 8-11am

Coaching Keys

* One coach should **always get off the dock in the launch** prior to any hulls launching.  
  * The other coach can stay on the dock to help launch  
* Make sure that your launch is set up prior to the start of class so it is ready and out of the way.    
  * Ensure that your megaphone is working prior to launching.  
* Always use the islands as the turn point and be mindful of the wind direction as you are going through a practice as it can increase the amount of time that it takes to get students back to the dock  
* When returning to the dock one coach can work back to the dock to help recover but the other coach should remain on the water until all shells are recovered  
* When someone flips in open water encourage them to swim the boat towards shore and find a area where they can stand to get in  
* Giving regular feedback on how rowers are progressing as it relates to the theme for that day 

**Handling Weather**

During the summer there is always the chance of thunderstorms rolling through either during practice or just prior or after.  Always monitor the weather and if there is visible lightning or thunder that can be heard it is a 30’ delay from the last instance before you can be back on the water.  

If there are storms in the area but it appears they will stay more than 20 miles away or you have cleared the 30’ time window then work to keep the class near the dock should you need to get back in quickly.

There is no ability to offer a make up class as we are fully booked into all weekends so canceling is the last resort.  Whether it is the first weekend of the last weekend of the class you can always bring folks down and spend time working with them on the erg, carrying and moving boats or talking over equipment on land.  You can also pull up sculling videos to watch on the TV by the workbench and give folks a chance to see and digest what you have been discussing.

Short of a tornado or storms so severe driving would be dangerous every effort should be made to bring folks down to the boathouse and use the time set aside for the class to learn and progress.

If you feel the need to cancel please reach out to club Director Russ Giacobbe or Sculling Head Coach Tom Kraft prior to canceling to come up with a plan for the class.

Notes to students

* **Do not use any other hull without permission from [Tom Kraft](mailto:tom-kraft@sbcglobal.net) or Russ**

	  
**Day 1:  Learning the Motion and Getting Wet.**

* Start with a basic introduction of the coaches and have the rowers introduce themselves to each other and why they are down taking the class.  
* Start on the rowing machine teaching the basic motion of the rowing stroke  
  * Pick Drill vs Reverse Pick Drill  
  * Sequencing emphasis  
  * How to hold the handle  
  * Application of pressure  
* Discuss the difference between sweep and scull from a physical standpoint.  
* Move to a equipment overview with a boat in slings (30 minutes with Tom?)  
  * Boat parts  
  * why and how to adjust foot stretchers  
  * Spacers \- what they’re for, why you’d change them, how to change  
  * Also cover oars  
* On and off the rack and boat carrying  
  * Take turns practicing  
  * Carry on edge not hull \- [How to carry a single on your shoulder](https://youtu.be/6f0YLIs5H9A?feature=shared)  
  * Strapping on outside racks  
  * Where to find slings and stepladders  
  * Outside rack \- bow balls to the boathouse  
* Flip test- start with a demo of setting boat with hands together and blades on the water, then demo flip recovery. [lars flip test demo.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vkSny5g6KqPR4QF2qX_R5Ae796yuZ8SJ/view?usp=drive_link) [johanna flip test demo.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vWb5AFLw8dHOC6W5gHRGCz8K-wFJCGrg/view?usp=drive_link)  
  * Work from the dock one at a time.    
  * Teach folks getting into and out of the boat  
  * Instructor sits off the south end of the dock holding onto the stern of the boat to keep the hull close to the dock and not drift off  
    * Also allows the instructor to assist and manipulate the hull.  
    * Makes it easier to bring the boat back to the dock when most folks won't be able to back the hull to the dock  
  * Prior to flipping have them take a few ghost strokes on the feather \- include in demo  
    * Teach them how to basically manipulate the handles and the oars blades  
    * Have them take the lightest arms only strokes while you hold onto the stern so they can feel the connection.


* If you progress through the flip test quickly enough and have time to leave the dock have folks each get oars down and launch for a short row. There is no reason to rush this\! If you have just a small amount of time, have rowers sit in a boat at the dock to get some boat feel \- explain getting in and out of the boat, how to hold the oars, adjust foot stretchers.  If in doubt go back to the erg and delay getting on the water to Day 2\.  
  * Prior to launching a coach should head out in a boat to demonstrate the sequence of arms only, arms body and then lengthening the slide and adding a little more legs as you pick up some boat speed

What to do if a rower cannot get back in the boat on Day 1:

* Assess the rower’s ability and comfort level in the water and assign boats accordingly. A wider rec boat like one of the WinTechs may be a good choice. IF necessary pontoons can be used but it’s not ideal. Questions about boat assignments? Contact Tom or Russ.  
* The rower need to wear a PFD.  
* Allow them to re-test another day at the end of a LTS session. Do not hold up the class.


Post Rowing Maintenance:

* Cleaning the Boat  
  Before putting the boat back on its rack, place it on the stretchers/slings and thoroughly wipe it down using a rag/towel provided by the club. This ensures the equipment is clean and ready for the next use.  
* Storing the Boat  
  After cleaning, place the boat back in its original rack position. Ensure the riggers align with those of other boats on the rack to maintain uniformity and balance. Outside racks \- bow balls point to the boathouse. Make sure it is properly supported to prevent damage.  
* Strapping the Boat \- Straps are flat, buckles don’t touch the boat, snug the straps so it can’t be blown off the rack in a windstorm but not harder.   
* Oar Handles  
  Routinely disinfect oar handles after each row. This is crucial for maintaining hygiene and preventing the spread of germs, especially given the likelihood of blisters and potential bleeding. Additionally, it removes residues from bandages or tapes some rowers might use.  
* Reporting Issues  
  Please note any issues with the equipment in the logbook.

**Day 2:  Hitting the Water–Basic Stroke Sequencing**

* Start with a brush up of process as it relates to equipment and boat sign out.  
* Do a 15’ erg warm up, reinforcing body position and sequencing from Day 1  
* Remind folks of the motion and sequencing   
* Have folks get oars down and then get boats down to the dock  
  * Encourage folks to give a go at carrying solo but if needed carrying with a partner can be done  
* Brush up on the launch procedure once on the dock and remind folks about how to create stability in the boat when they have a off stroke  
  * Sitting up tall through the hips and bring the handles back together  
* ***Teach folks basic turning***.  Rowing only with one arm at a time and then ensuring you make it to 90

*Coach Demo for the Day*

* Demo sequencing and the drill work  
* Basics of one arm steering

*Drills for the Day:*  

* Pick Drill for morning session, pause drills for post-break session  
  * Pauses are about thinking about body positioning and where you should actually be vs where you are at the pause. Demo arms away and body over pauses.

**Day 3:  Learning How to Push**

* Brush up on the previous weekend and remind folks about procedure  
* Demo on the erg the difference between little push and good push  
* Use boathouse map to describe river geography.   
* Talk about steering, finding a point rather than following the shoreline, staying on the correct side of the river, how to pass/be passed. Look over alternating shoulders every 3-5 strokes on the drive. Do not stop to look.  
* Traffic pattern including how and where to spin.   
* Bridge traffic pattern \- you do NOT have to have everyone go through but they should know where to be  
* Start to reinforce river turns and teach how to pivot the boat when turning  
  * One hand backing while the other rows arms only

*Coach Demo for the Day*

* Teaching folks how to push and use the legs   
* Demo the difference between good push and soft push

Drills for the Day:

* Reverse pick  starting as far into the catch as comfortable  
  * Focusing on learning to push to engage the blades vs pulling through the hands.  Want to teach folks that the front end is a function of pressing to change direction.

**Day 4: Navigation and Working Up River**

Focus for the day:  Teaching proper navigation and conditioning folks that where they are on the river is important and their responsibility.  Call folks out on it and do not allow them to continue rowing on the wrong side of the river. Explain the traffic pattern through the bridges. There is no passing through the bridges. *Do not take rowers through the bridges if they are not ready.*

*Who should be encouraged to go through the bridges… able to control the direction of their boat, able to row continuously so they can get through the bridges without stopping, competent steering.*

* Start with a quick reminder of what happened the prior day and then get folks launched.  
  * If the weather is good go ahead and launch off the dock and head across the river and get your students headed up river to head through the bridges and row the upper portion of the river  
    * Divide them into two groups based on competency and have a coach lead each group through the bridges  
    * Remind folks to constantly be looking over their shoulder every 2-3 strokes  
* Give folks a chance that did not pass the swim test a chance to take the flip test again.
