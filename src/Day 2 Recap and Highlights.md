Subject: Day 2 Recap and Highlights

Dear LTS4 Students,  
   
Great job on completing Day 2 of the Learn to Scull class\! Here’s a detailed summary of  
what we covered and some key techniques to review.  
   
**Day 2 Recap: Hitting the Water–Basic Stroke Sequencing**

1. Equipment and Boat Sign Out:  
   * Brushed up on the process related to equipment and boat sign out.  
2. 15-Minute Erg Warm-Up:  
   * Practiced the Pick Drill, Reverse Pick Drill, and Pause Drills to reinforce body position and sequencing from Day 1\.  
   * Reminded everyone of the motion and sequencing.  
3. Sculling Grip (see [video link](https://youtu.be/UIDwzwSsXtI) below):  
   * Demonstrated the correct sculling grip:  
     * Hold the handle with a loose grip at the base of the fingers, with the thumb on the end applying light outward pressure.  
     * Create a hook with your fingers to hang your weight off each handle, keeping the wrist as flat as possible throughout the stroke.  
     * To feather the blade, turn the handle with your thumb while opening your fingers, keeping your hand relaxed and wrist flat.  
     * Maintain a fist and a half gap at the finish for a clean movement around the extraction.  
     * On the recovery, the left hand should lead away with the right hand following slightly behind and underneath the left.  
4. Getting Boats and Oars to the Dock:  
   * Practiced getting oars down and then getting boats down to the dock in pairs.  
5. Launching Procedure:  
   * We reviewed the launch procedure once on the dock.  
   * Reminded everyone how to create stability in the boat when they have an off stroke by sitting up tall through the hips and bringing the handles back together.  
6. Basic Turning:  
   * Learned basic turning by rowing only with one arm at a time and ensuring you make it to 90 degrees.  
7. Docking the Boat:  
   * Approach the dock slowly and align the boat parallel to it.  
   * Once the boat is stationary, rowers should carefully exit the boat.  
   * Walk the boat down the dock to make room for other returning rowers.  
8. Getting Boats and Oars Off the Dock:  
   * Return and Clean the Boat:  
     * Carry the boat back and place it in slings (bottom-up).  
     * Use rags to wipe down the boat thoroughly.  
   * Store the Boat:  
     * Return the boat to its original rack position.  
     * Ensure proper alignment of the rigger with other boats and secure with flat straps.  
   * Handle the Oars:  
     * Get the oars from the dock and disinfect the oar handles with wipes.  
     * Store the oars in the designated indoor or outdoor racks.  
   * Sign the Boat Back In:  
     * Sign the boat back in using the logbook. Note any equipment issues in the logbook.  
9. River Geography and Traffic Patterns:  
   * Discussed river geography, steering, and following the river traffic pattern.  
   * Emphasized the importance of looking over alternating shoulders every 3-5 strokes on the drive without stopping.

Tomorrow we will follow up with information on continuing to scull with AARC after the class ends next weekend.

We look forward to seeing you on Saturday for Day 3 when we will continue spending more time on the water and on the skills you've learned.  
   
If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reply to this email.

Best,  
Margaret and Lars
