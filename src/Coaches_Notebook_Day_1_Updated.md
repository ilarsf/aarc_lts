# **Coaches' Notebook: Day 1 \- Learning the Motion and Getting Wet**

## **Class Time: 8:00 AM \- 11:00 AM**

## **Preparation**

\- Dock Management: One coach should get off the dock in the launch before any boats are launched. The other coach helps launch boats and stays until all boats are recovered.  
\- Safety Equipment: Check that all necessary safety equipment is in place.

## **Introduction**

\- Welcome and Introductions:  
  \- Introduce the coaches.  
  \- Have rowers introduce themselves and share why they are taking the class.

## **Additional Points for Coaches**

Launch Setup: Ensure your launch is ready before the class starts. Test the megaphone.

## **Hulls to Use**

\- Boats: P1, P2, P3, P4, W1, W3, W4.  
\- Notes:   
  \- W1, W3, and W4 can be rowed with pontoons.  
  \- Use P3 for the flip test and drain the boat and oars afterward.  
  \- Do not use other hulls without permission from Tom Kraft or Russ Giacobbe.

## **Key Points to Reinforce**

1\. Safely carrying and moving equipment.  
2\. Understanding and executing the traffic pattern.  
3\. Demonstrating water safety and the ability to re-enter the boat after flipping.

## **Land Training**

### **Rowing Machine (Erg) Training:**

Teach the basic rowing stroke motion.

#### ***Drills:***

##### Pick Drill:

\- Sequence:   
  1\. Arms-only rowing.  
  2\. Arms and body.  
  3\. Quarter slide.  
  4\. Half slide.  
  5\. Three-quarter slide.  
  6\. Full slide.  
\- Purpose: This drill helps isolate each part of the stroke to improve the sequence and develop muscle memory. It starts with simpler motions and progressively incorporates more complex elements of the stroke.  
\- Instructions: Start from the finish position (legs extended, body leaned back slightly). Begin with arms only, pulling the handle to the body. Add the body swing next, and then progressively include more leg compression until reaching the full stroke.

##### Reverse Pick Drill:

\- Sequence:   
  1\. Legs only.  
  2\. Legs and body.  
  3\. Full stroke.  
\- Purpose: This drill focuses on body positioning and smooth power application throughout the stroke, starting from the catch position and gradually incorporating the body and arms.  
\- Instructions: Begin at the catch position (shins vertical, arms extended). First, push with just the legs, keeping the arms straight and body forward. Next, add the body swing after the legs extend. Finally, complete the stroke by adding the arm pull.

#### ***Key Points:***

\- How to hold the handle: Ensure a relaxed grip, wrists flat, fingers draped over the handle.  
\- Application of pressure: Demonstrate light pressure to avoid overexertion and ensure smooth motion.  
\- Difference between sweep (one oar per rower) and scull (two oars per rower): Explain the fundamentals of each style and how they differ in technique and boat handling.

### **Equipment Overview:**

Use a boat in slings to demonstrate:  
\- Parts of the boat and oars: Explain the function of each part (e.g., rigger, oarlock, seat, slides, bow, stern).  
\- Proper boat handling and carrying techniques: Show how to lift and carry the boat safely to avoid injury.  
\- Strapping boats on outside racks (bow balls to the boathouse): Ensure secure storage of boats.  
\- Using slings and stepladders: Demonstrate how to use slings for boat maintenance and storage.

#### ***Practice:***

Allow students to practice carrying the boat on edge (not hull) and on their shoulders. Emphasize teamwork and coordination to handle the boat safely.

## **Water Training**

### **Flip Test:**

\- Demo: Show setting the boat with hands together and blades on the water. Demonstrate flip recovery.  
\- Practice:  
  \- Students work from the dock, one at a time.  
  \- Instructor holds the stern to keep the hull close to the dock.  
  \- Practice getting into and out of the boat.  
  \- Take a few ghost strokes on the feather to feel the connection.  
\- Light Strokes: While holding the stern, students take the lightest arms-only strokes to get a feel for the boat.

### **Re-entering the Shell:**

\- Setting Up the Boat:  
  1\. Position the oars perpendicular to the boat and flat on the water to help stabilize the boat.  
\- For students with strong upper body strength:  
  1\. Position yourself on the side of the shell, close to the seat.  
  2\. Use your arms to lift your body up and over the gunwale (the edge of the boat).  
  3\. Swing your legs over and into the seat.  
  4\. Sit down gently to avoid tipping the boat again.  
\- For students with different levels of strength:  
  1\. Position yourself at the stern or bow of the shell, where the boat is more stable.  
  2\. Use a scissor kick to help propel your body upward while using your arms to pull yourself over the gunwale.  
  3\. Slide your body along the shell until you reach the seat.  
  4\. Carefully swing your legs in and sit down.

Tips:  
\- Keep your body low and centered to maintain balance.  
\- Move slowly and deliberately to avoid capsizing again.  
\- Use the oars to help stabilize the boat by keeping them flat on the water.

### **Launching:**

\- If time allows after the flip test, have each student get oars down and launch for a short row.  
\- No Rush: If needed, delay getting on the water until Day 2 and use more erg practice.

### **On-Water Demo:**

A coach demonstrates the sequence: arms only, arms and body, then lengthening the slide and adding more legs as speed increases.

## **Safety and Weather**

\- Weather Monitoring: Monitor for thunderstorms. If lightning or thunder is observed, delay rowing by 30 minutes from the last instance.  
\- Safety Protocol: If storms are nearby, stay close to the dock. In severe weather, canceling is a last resort. If canceling, contact the club director or head coach first.

## **Post-Session**

\- Equipment Maintenance:  
  \- Clean the boats before storing them on the racks.  
  \- Disinfect oar handles.  
  \- Report any equipment issues in the logbook.
