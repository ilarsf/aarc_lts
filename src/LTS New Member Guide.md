**Welcome to the Ann Arbor Rowing Club\!**

**This manual serves as a resource for LTS students entering Phase 2 of the program and what to do after that** 

1. [Phase 2 of LTS: Open Sculling Trial Period](#bookmark=id.3uo1y7ujng7x) (p. 1-3)  
2. [How to continue rowing with AARC after Phase 2](#bookmark=id.nsiy5faikf9x)  (p. 3-6)

# **1\. Phase 2 of LTS: Open Sculling Trial Period**

In the first four sessions of the Learn-to-scull class (Phase 1), your coach(es) oriented you to the technique of rowing and some of the terms, rules, and etiquette of the sport. In Phase 2, you will join the Open Sculling Program to further improve technique, skill, and stamina in rowing. This document is designed to help you with the logistics that you will need to know for this phase. 

# **A. How to sign-up to continue with Phase 2**  

If you continue on with AARC after the LTS class, you will be able to continue with the Open Sculling Program for four weeks.  The Open Sculling Program is also designed for all scullers, regardless of experience level, to master certain skills and for adults returning to the sport of rowing after a long hiatus.

# **B. Becoming and AARC member** 

To become a member, go to the [Membership Page](https://aarc.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=757878&module_id=558993) and click on the **Full Membership** agreement (note that there is a $25 charge for membership).  Once you become a member, you can login the AARC website (a2crew.com), and you will find additional resources available, including the club’s system to request to be boated for practices (see section “[1D](#bookmark=id.6gpkn5yiaovo)” below)  and  “For Members Only” links.  As a member you will also receive the weekly electronic publication, “The Weekly Catch,” which provides information about upcoming events and other items relevant to the club.  

# **C. Joining US Rowing and Completing Safe Sport training** 

USRowing membership is required to join AARC.  USRowing membership costs $25.00 for a basic membership.   

Please complete the steps outlined here:  
**Log into: [https://membership.usrowing.org/](https://membership.usrowing.org/)**

1. Select "Individuals" and choose either “Join” or “Members”(There is a $25.00 fee if you are joining for the first time, $20.00 for annual renewal)  
2. Follow the prompts; the AARC club code is: CZGBS  
3. 3 documents need to be signed  
   1. membership agreement  
   2. waiver  
   3. safe sport attestation (see next paragraph)

   4\. After you complete these steps, AARC will receive notice.

All team sports in the United States participate in the Safe Sport program.  This is designed to protect young athletes from predatory behavior of coaches or other adults.   AARC is primarily a master's club, but we do have minor members every summer, and we employ minor coxen's when available. Every USRowing member must attest as to whether they are in regular contact with minors. Those who are need to complete Safe Sport training, which takes \~90 minutes the initial year, and 30 minutes each subsequent annual renewal.  You can find directions on how to access the Safe Sport training videos [here](https://usrowing.org/sports/2022/12/20/accessing-safesport-training.aspx). 

# **D. Weekly Sign-up**

You need to sign up each week for the sculling practice sessions you want to row. **Your request needs to be placed by Thursday at noon to row the following week.**  To do this, login to [https://aarc.clubexpress.com/](https://aarc.clubexpress.com/) and from the **homepage** (scroll down, left column), select “[**Sculling Weekly Request to Row Signup**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDGX7rR-vw-An65lW4bh4Qe6kZinbmMMU6Fp66kZrrgxCl3A/viewform)” and follow the link. Note that there is more than one week available; you may sign up for one week at a time or for all weeks listed (although we recommend only signing up for the following week, in case your schedule changes). Please note that even if you choose “row” for a particular session, you may be listed in the “available” section of the boatings if not enough boats are available.  For visual instructions on where to find this information, click [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XFdRQoETMIfzRkMaXHX8E3MYlUcEORY_QQ6BTEuQNJI/edit?usp=sharingv_YvDnP6ZIe5nnOa0/edit?usp=sharing).  

# **E. Check the website to see when you are boated**  

Check back on Sunday to see when you are scheduled to row. To do this, login to[ https://aarc.clubexpress.com/ ](https://aarc.clubexpress.com/)and from the homepage, under “Weekly Schedule,” (scroll down and look at the left column)  select “Current Week’s Schedule,” and open the tab in the schedule for “Sculling”. 

# **F.  Come down to the river and row\!**  

**Note: If you are assigned a boat, please show up or let the coach know.** Many people are looking to participate in our practices and we have limited equipment so please let the coach know if you are boated and cannot be there so that another rower may use the equipment.  

# **G. Arrive at 6:15 pm (Mon/Wed), 6:45 am (Tues/Thurs/Sun)**

I**t is very important to show up to practices on time**.  “On time” means 15 minutes before practice begins in order to prepare the equipment, so for most of the summer that means 6:15 pm for the evening session, 6:45 am for the weekday morning sessions, and 7:15 am for the Sunday sessions.  When rowers are on time, we can be prepared for the water at practice time.  Coaches can then launch rowers together for productive practices.  

# **H. If you can’t make it to your scheduled practice**

Of course, things come up unexpectedly and sometimes you just can’t make it.  If you need to miss a practice last minute please also email the coach in charge of the practice and let them know so that equipment can be reassigned and other rowers accommodated; the coaches are also found in the membership directory.  

# **I. Inclement Weather **

If practice needs to be canceled due to inclement weather, the coaches will send out an email 30 minutes before practice, if at all possible. In most cases, practice will be shifted to an indoor erg workout at the boathouse.

# **2\. How to continue rowing with AARC after Phase 2**

# **A. How to sign-up to continue with the Open Sculling Program**  

Have you caught the rowing bug? We hope that you enjoyed your Learn-to-scull experience and that you consider continuing on with AARC.  If you would like to register for sculling beyond your class, we have pro-rated the seasonal program fee for each LTS class.  Please refer to the table on the [Learn-to-Scull page](https://aarc.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=757878&module_id=201828) (scroll to the bottom) and select the appropriate prorated session under “Phase 3.” You must sign up and pay the program fees to continue sculling after your 4-week Phase 2 period. 

# **B. River Rules**  

We share the river with the Pioneer, Huron, and U-M men’s crew teams.  In addition, there are often canoers, kayakers, paddle-boarders, and sometimes even swimmers that you will be navigating around.  

River rules are essentially the same as road rules:  Stay on the right side of the river and pass on the left.  However, you will find that is not always the best passing choice; the coach of the practice will help you determine the best way to steer around other boats in your path.  There are some shallow areas near shore, make sure you don’t get too close to the shoreline.

All boats should use a river turn at the dams (or bridges) when turning around.  This means that you stay on the right side of the river, come to a stop, turn to degrees to the left, row across the river, turn another 90 degrees, and wait in a safe area for the coach to tell you to resume.  When you are making your river turn near the dam, generally you row until you are under the power wires, then weigh enough, check the boat down to a stop, do your river turn, row across the river until even with the island, turn again and take some strokes to get out of the way of other boats that need to turn.  Then you can stop and make adjustments, get water, and hear the coach’s instructions.   If you are approaching the dam to turn and there are other boats doing the same, the boat closest to the shore should go further than the other boat to make its turn.  (If you think of a running track, the close-to-shore boat is taking the path of the outside lane).

Kayaks, canoes, paddle-boards, fishermen, etc., tend not to follow the river traffic rules and their movements can be difficult to predict.  Be very careful near them and ensure that you keep your boat and them safe.  Steer around them if you can, but stop if you have to.  You may be annoyed, but be courteous to everyone who shares the river with us.

Swimmers can be a hazard in the peak of summer.  They are hard to see and are unpredictable in their actions.  As you row past the dock, be watchful for swimmers in your path. You may have to row farther away from shore than normal, or even stop rowing briefly to get a safe path around them.

Weeds are another hazard as the summer progresses.  They are usually pretty visible along the shoreline (especially around the big bend in the river as you head downriver) and you will need to avoid steering the boat into them as it causes the oars to get caught and it is difficult to navigate out of them.  Again, your coach can offer tips for how to avoid the weeds.  

# **C. Member Duties and Stewardship**  

Members are expected to pitch in to keep things running smoothly and cost effectively. Throughout the season there are many opportunities to help, typically advertised in the Weekly Catch and/or solicited through a SignUp Genius directed at all members (you can access the current SignUp Genius on the homepage under “Stewardship”).  There are two types of duties:  Weekly Tasks (such as boathouse sweeping, laundering of towels, etc.) and Ad Hoc Tasks (single events such as Clean-Up Days, Spring Open House, etc.).  All members are expected to attend the boathouse workdays at the beginning and end of the season to prepare for the opening day on the water or to close things up for the winter.  If there's a skill you have that you could contribute \- accounting, web editing/design, etc. \- volunteer to help unsolicited or respond to a call for help when one is published in the Weekly Catch.

# **D. Winter Training**  

Once the on-the-water season winds down, the Winter Training program (on the ergs) will begin.  There is no differentiation between sweep and sculling rowers during winter training, we all erg together\! Erging helps you develop more power and fitness, as well as helping with the mechanics of the stroke.  The coach can watch you more closely than when you’re in a boat.

There are typically coached practices on weekday mornings and evenings (with one weekend session) running from December through the end of March.  The location for winter erging has varied year-to-year, but is announced in the Catch in the fall.  Sign-ups for Winter Training will be advertised in The Catch and will be available through the website link.
