Additional instruction on how to re-enter capsized craft from the water will be provided and students will practice this.

* Participants will use of AARC boats and equipment during lessons  
* A 30 minute break is scheduled each day. Bring **your own** **water** and a snack.  
* Social events with new rowers and AARC members will help participants learn more about the sport and the club

* USRowing Learn-to-Row membership ($10) including signed waiver (information will be emailed to registrants to complete this immediately preceding the start of the class session)  
* With training, you must be able to safely move and transport a single scull weighing 40-50 pounds and 27' in length  
* Must be able to turn head to look overshoulders in **both** directions

**After completion of the LTS class**

Immediately after successful completion of the LTS class, the sculler is invited to become a Full Member of AARC and participate in our coached [**Open Sculling**](https://aarc.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=757878&module_id=131640) Program. The first four weeks immediately following the completion of your class are offered at a discounted rate as a trial period. This allows the new sculler to experience continued growth in skills, fitness and comfort on water and confirm that rowing and AARC are a fit. Please note there is no flexibility on which 4 weeks are offered at a discount.

After the 4-week Open Sculling Trial period, we hope you will continue to row with us. If you do, you will need to register for the remainder of the Open Sculling Program season and pay appropriate seasonal fees, as well as upgrade your USRowing membership.

You will receive more information about registering for the Open Sculling Program via email once you have started your LTS class.

**Is a Learn-to-scull class right for me?**  
   
There is no training or fitness level necessary for this class, but sculling requires a certain amount of mobility to enter and exit the boat safely and be safe on the water. If you are able to **get down to the floor in a sitting position using only one hand, and then get back up again**, you should be fine. You MUST be able to turn your head to look over your shoulder in both directions to be able to row safely. If you have difficulties with these maneuvers, you may want to take a mobility course (e.g., yoga, tai chi, etc.) to improve your flexibility before enrolling in the class. If you have specific questions, please contact us at info@a2crew.com.
