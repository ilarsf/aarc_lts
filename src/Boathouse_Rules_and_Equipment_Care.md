# Boathouse Rules and Equipment Care

Proper care and handling of equipment not only extends its lifespan but also ensures it remains in good working condition for everyone. This guide covers important boathouse etiquette and equipment maintenance responsibilities.

## General Boathouse Rules

* **Sign Out/In:** Always record your boat usage in the logbook, including any issues encountered during your row.
* **Footwear:** Wear appropriate footwear in the boathouse. No street shoes on the dock or in the boats.
* **Quiet Hours:** Respect neighbors by minimizing noise during early morning hours.
* **Security:** The last person leaving the boathouse is responsible for ensuring all doors and gates are locked.
* **Keep Pathways Clear:** Never leave equipment blocking walkways, doorways, or launch areas.

## Equipment Handling and Storage

### Boat Handling

* **Carrying Boats:** Always lift with proper technique and adequate help. Listen to experienced rowers regarding the correct carrying positions.
* **Using Slings/Stretchers:** Place boats carefully on stretchers when adjusting foot stretchers or performing maintenance.
* **Step Ladders:** Use the provided step ladders for reaching high racks; never climb on the racks themselves. Return ladders to their designated storage locations after use.

### Boat Maintenance

1. **Cleaning the Boat**  
   Before putting the boat back on its rack, place it on the stretchers/slings and thoroughly wipe it down using a rag/towel provided by the club. This ensures the equipment is clean and ready for the next use.

2. **Storing the Boat**  
   After cleaning, place the boat back in its original rack position. Ensure the riggers align with those of other boats on the rack to maintain uniformity and balance. Make sure it is properly supported to prevent damage.

3. **Reporting Issues**  
   Please note any issues with the equipment in the logbook. If there is significant damage, also notify a coach or club officer immediately.

### Oar Care and Storage

* **Oar Storage:** Return oars to their designated racks after use, as indicated by the rack labels, with blades facing in the correct direction.

* **Oar Cleaning:** After each use, rinse oars with fresh water if available, paying special attention to the collars and gates.

* **Oar Handles**  
   Routinely disinfect oar handles after each row. This is crucial for maintaining hygiene and preventing the spread of germs, especially given the likelihood of blisters and potential bleeding. Additionally, it removes residues from bandages or tapes some rowers might use.

* **Tape Removal:** If you've used tape for blisters, remove residues completely after your row. Sticky residue makes handles uncomfortable for the next user.

## Considerate Use of Facilities

* **Changing Rooms:** Keep changing areas tidy and remove all personal belongings after use.
* **Bathrooms:** Leave the facilities as you would like to find them.
* **Trash:** Dispose of all waste properly and recycle when possible.
* **Personal Items:** Do not leave valuables unattended in the boathouse.

## Equipment Respect Philosophy

Remember that rowing equipment is both expensive and delicate. Approach each interaction with equipment by following these principles:

* **Respect Your Future Self:** The care you take now ensures the equipment will be in good condition for your next row.
* **Respect Your Peers:** Other rowers deserve to use well-maintained equipment just as you do.
* **Respect the Club's Investment:** Proper care of equipment protects the club's financial investment and allows resources to be directed to improvements rather than replacements.
