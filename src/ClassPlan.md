#### **Session 1: Drill Explanations & Coaching Insights**

* **Erg - Pick Drill:**
    * **Execution:** Start at finish. 1) Arms away only -> 2) Arms + Body Pivot -> 3) Add 1/4, 1/2, Full Slide.
    * **Purpose:** Teaches recovery sequence (Arms->Body->Slide), hands away, posture. Connects to KRAFT: *Sequencing*.
* **Erg - Reverse Pick Drill:**
    * **Execution:** Start at catch. 1) Legs only drive -> 2) Legs + Back Swing -> 3) Full Stroke (add arms).
    * **Purpose:** Establishes leg drive primacy, prevents early arm/back use, teaches connection. Connects to KRAFT: *Sequencing*, *Application of Pressure*.
* **Dockside - Ghost Strokes:**
    * **Execution:** Minimal pressure strokes while stabilized at dock, focus on handle movement, feather/square.
    * **Purpose:** Builds confidence with oar control & stability effect in safe setting. Connects to KRAFT: *Correct Grip*, *Horizontal*.

> **💡 Coaching Tip (Day 1):** Use analogies: "Grip like holding a baby bird"; "Arms straight like ropes". Keep instructions simple and focused. Praise effort and small successes, especially during the flip test.

> **⚠️ Caution (Day 1):** Erg errors are common. Correct gently: "Relax fingers"; "Legs push first"; "Sit tall". Flip test anxiety is normal; maintain a calm, supportive presence. Ensure clear communication during boat handling. Provide physical assistance for re-entry as needed. Correct common errors like pulling *down* instead of *across* during re-entry.

* **Pivot Turns:**
    * **Execution:** Gently back water with one oar while taking light forward strokes with the other.
    * **Purpose:** Essential skill for maneuvering in confined spaces (turning buoys, docking).

> **💡 Coaching Tip (Day 3):** Connect the "push" feeling from the erg to the water. Use tactile cues if appropriate ("Feel the pressure on your feet"). Make navigation practice active - ask rowers to identify landmarks ("What are you steering towards?") and call out checks ("Look now!").

> **⚠️ Caution (Day 3):** Address weak leg drive/arm pulling ("Push foot stretchers away!") and bum shoving ("Connect legs & back"). Reinforce frequent looking (every 3-5 strokes) for safety. Immediately correct traffic pattern violations (wrong side, cutting corners) using clear commands (whistle/megaphone).

#### **Session 4: Drill Explanations & Coaching Insights**

* **Continuous Rowing with Navigation Focus:**
    * **Execution:** Maintain stroke rhythm while actively steering, monitoring position, looking frequently, anticipating turns/obstacles.
    * **Purpose:** Integrate all learned skills in a practical, dynamic setting; test multitasking ability. Links to all KRAFT/BBS elements.
* **Bridge Passage Practice (Group 1 Option):**
    * **Execution:** Guided practice rowing through designated bridge arches, focusing on straight course, judging clearance, no passing rule.
    * **Purpose:** Build confidence and competence navigating a common hazard safely. Addresses safety/traffic patterns.

> **💡 Coaching Tip (Day 4):** Encourage rowers to take ownership of their navigation. Ask questions like "Where should you be?" or "What's your next steering point?". Use the Rower Assessment Checklist (Appendix A) for specific, actionable feedback during the wrap-up, highlighting both strengths and areas for continued practice.

> **⚠️ Caution (Day 4):** Navigation errors: Fixating ("Look PAST the boat ahead"), wrong side ("Anticipate turns, move early"), stopping to look ("Quick glances *while* rowing"). Technique decay under pressure is common; remind them of basics ("Find rhythm"). Bridge errors: Hesitation ("Commit to your line"), too close to abutments ("Aim for center"). Assess readiness carefully before attempting bridge passage.

### 3.4. Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

> **Scenario:** Rower repeatedly struggles with balance (tipping excessively).
> **Troubleshooting Steps:**
> 1.  **Check Basics:** Hand heights (level?), grip (relaxed?), posture (tall?), tension (shoulders down?).
> 2.  **Drills:** Use square blade rowing; practice "Set the Boat" at dock; pause drills.
> 3.  **Equipment:** Verify boat stability is appropriate; check riggers/oars.
> 4.  **Environment:** Move to calmer water.
> 5.  **Support:** Provide verbal cues; more direct stability if needed initially.

> **Scenario:** Group consistently fails to maintain starboard course.
> **Troubleshooting Steps:**
> 1.  **Stop & Correct:** Use whistle/megaphone.
> 2.  **Re-orient:** Use clear landmarks. Review traffic pattern diagram (on land if needed).
> 3.  **Reinforce Looking:** "Look every 3-5 strokes! What do you see?"
> 4.  **Practice Steering:** Dedicated time for small corrections using pressure difference.
> 5.  **Follow the Leader:** Have group follow coach launch or a confident rower.

> **Scenario:** Sudden weather change (wind picks up, thunder heard).
> **Troubleshooting Steps:**
> 1.  **Immediate Action:** Signal ALL boats to stop rowing and head DIRECTLY to dock (use established signal).
> 2.  **Consolidate:** Keep group together during return.
> 3.  **Safety Launch Position:** Position launch to assist/monitor all boats effectively.
> 4.  **Dock Procedure:** Manage landings efficiently, get boats/people off water quickly.
> 5.  **Accountability:** Check logbook/roster to ensure everyone is accounted for.

    * Traffic Pattern: Stay Starboard (Right), pass Port-to-Port, counter-clockwise turns, specific bridge rules apply. Look around constantly.
    * Safety Equipment: PFDs accessible (in launch or boat if uncoached), boats need bow balls, lights required for dark rowing.
    * Capsize: Stay with the boat. Assist others in distress.
    * Equipment: Use logbook for sign-out/in and issue reporting. Handle boats/oars carefully. Report damage immediately. No rigging changes without approval (except stretchers/oarlock height). Launches are safety vehicles.

### Appendix D: Embedded Technical Guides (Summarized)

#### D.1: Self-Rescue / Flip Test Procedure

*(Condensed from Sculling_Self_Rescue_Guide.md / AARC_Flip_Test_Instructions_20240803.md)*

1.  **Capsize:** Intentionally flip (during test) or react calmly if accidental.
2.  **Stay with Boat:** Hold onto the hull. Secure floating oars.
3.  **Right the Boat (if needed):** Reach across hull, grab far gunwale, pull towards you gently.
4.  **Position Oars:** Arrange oars perpendicular to boat (T-shape), blades flat (feathered) on water for stability. Overlap handles near cockpit.
5.  **Prepare Re-entry:** Position yourself mid-boat. Grasp overlapped handles with stern-ward hand, other hand on boat center/gunwale.
6.  **Kick & Hip Lift:** Take breath, dip slightly, execute powerful upward kick (dolphin/scissor). Simultaneously push down on handles/boat. Drive HIPS onto gunwale/deck.
7.  **Tummy Flop & Roll:** Once hips are across, pause briefly, then roll body towards boat center.
8.  **Swing Leg Over:** Swing far leg over hull into cockpit.
9.  **Sit Up Slowly:** Bring other leg in, keep weight low, shift carefully onto seat.
10. **Regain Control:** Immediately grasp handles, keep blades flat on water for stability. Bail if necessary. Assess situation.

#### D.2: Hand Care - Blister Prevention & Treatment

*(Condensed from Rowers_Hand_Blister_Treatment.md)*

* **Prevention:**
    * **Proper Grip:** Relaxed "hook" grip (fingers, not palm), light pressure, especially recovery. (Video: `[TODO: Insert Valid YouTube Link for Correct Grip]` - placeholder ID 3 was invalid)
    * **Gradual Conditioning:** Allow hands/calluses to adapt over time.
    * **Taping:** Apply athletic tape to clean, dry hotspots *before* rowing. Smooth application essential.
* **Treatment:**
    * **Intact Blisters:** Clean. Keep small ones intact. Cover with hydrocolloid bandage or non-stick pad + tape. Drain large/painful ones carefully with sterile needle at edge, apply ointment, cover.
    * **Broken Blisters:** Clean gently. Leave attached skin flap. Apply ointment. Cover with non-stick dressing + tape. Change daily/after rowing.
    * **Watch for Infection:** Increasing redness, pain, swelling, pus, warmth, red streaks -> seek medical attention.
* **Rowing with Blisters:**
    * Protect wound with non-stick barrier *before* taping.
    * Remove tape after rowing to clean/air.
    * Gloves are a temporary option.
* **Callus Care:** Smooth thick calluses gently with pumice stone. Moisturize (but not right before rowing). Don't cut/pick.
