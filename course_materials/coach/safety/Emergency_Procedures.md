# Emergency Procedures

<div class="info-box warning">
  <h4>Safety Resource</h4>
  <p>This guide outlines essential protocols for responding to emergency situations that may occur during rowing activities. Familiarize yourself with these procedures before each season and review regularly.</p>
</div>

## Quick Reference: Emergency Response Steps

1. **Assess** the situation
2. **Alert** others to the emergency
3. **Act** according to appropriate protocol
4. **Access** help and resources
5. **Attend** to affected individuals
6. **Aftermath** procedures and documentation

## Communication Systems

### Emergency Signal Hierarchy

1. **Verbal Commands:**
   - "HELP!" - Basic call for assistance
   - "EMERGENCY!" - Indicates serious situation
   - Specific calls: "MAN OVERBOARD!", "MEDICAL EMERGENCY!", etc.

2. **Whistle Signals:**
   - One blast = Attention/stop
   - Three blasts = Emergency assistance needed
   - Continuous blasts = Urgent emergency/immediate danger

3. **Visual Signals:**
   - Waving both arms overhead repeatedly = Universal distress signal
   - Single arm raised vertically = Need assistance
   - Paddle/oar raised and waved = Emergency situation

4. **Radio/Phone Communication:**
   - Channel/Number: **[PLACEHOLDER: Add your club's emergency channel]**
   - Standard opening: "Mayday, Mayday, Mayday" for life-threatening emergencies
   - "Pan-Pan, Pan-Pan, Pan-Pan" for urgent but not immediately life-threatening situations

## Water Emergencies

### Capsize Response

**If You Capsize:**
1. Stay with the boat - it provides flotation
2. Perform self-rescue if possible
3. If unable to re-enter, hold onto boat and signal for help
4. In cold water, minimize movement to conserve heat
5. If near shore and unable to re-enter, swim boat to shore (only if safe to do so)

**If You Witness a Capsize:**
1. Alert other boats and coaches
2. If coach launch is present, allow them to respond first
3. If no launch, approach carefully:
   - Call out to check on rower's condition
   - Offer assistance only if you can do so safely
   - Do not place yourself at risk
4. If rower is struggling, call for emergency assistance

### Multiple Boat Capsize / Severe Weather

1. Account for all rowers immediately
2. Priority assistance to any injured rowers
3. Direct able rowers to nearest safe shore point
4. Coaches distribute PFDs if available
5. Use buddy system - pair experienced with less experienced
6. If rescue services deployed, keep group together for easier location

### Person Overboard (From Coach Boat)

1. Call "PERSON OVERBOARD!" and point continuously at person
2. Throw flotation device immediately
3. Establish visual contact - DO NOT LOSE SIGHT of person
4. Maneuver boat carefully for recovery - approach from downwind
5. Cut engine when near person
6. If person is injured or hypothermic, call emergency services immediately

### Boat Collision

1. Stop all boats involved immediately
2. Check for injuries to all persons - this is the priority
3. If serious injuries, call for emergency medical services
4. Stabilize damaged boats if possible
