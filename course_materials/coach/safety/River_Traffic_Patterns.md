# River Traffic Patterns

This guide outlines essential navigation rules and traffic patterns for safe rowing. Understanding and following these protocols is crucial for avoiding collisions and maintaining safety on shared waterways.

<div class="info-box tip">
  <h4>Teaching Note</h4>
  <p>Many novice rowers find it helpful to remember: "Stay to the right as in driving a car."</p>
</div>

## Basic Navigation Principles

### The Starboard Rule

The fundamental principle of rowing traffic patterns is the **starboard rule**: boats should stay to the starboard (right) side of the waterway relative to their direction of travel. This creates a consistent, predictable flow of traffic in both directions.

**Key Points:**
- Always row with the nearest shore on your starboard (right) side
- This applies regardless of boat type or direction of travel
- When in doubt, move further to starboard
- The rule creates a counter-clockwise pattern on most waterways

### Lane Discipline

While the waterway doesn't have marked lanes, conceptually dividing it helps maintain order:

**Three-Lane Concept:**
1. **Shore Lane:** Closest to the starboard shoreline (primary rowing lane)
2. **Middle Lane:** Used primarily for passing or when shore lane is obstructed
3. **Center/Far Lane:** Used only when necessary and with extreme caution

**Key Points:**
- Row primarily in the shore lane
- Maintain consistent distance from shore (approximately 10-30 meters as conditions allow)
- Center of river should remain clear for passing and navigation
- Avoid unnecessary lane changes

## Passing Procedures

### Overtaking Another Boat

When approaching a slower boat from behind:

1. Check thoroughly that passing lane is clear
2. Call out "Passing on your port!" to alert the boat being passed
3. Move toward middle lane to pass
4. Pass with adequate clearance (minimum 2-3 boat lengths)
5. Return to shore lane once safely past (minimum 2 boat lengths clear)

**Key Points:**
- Passing boat is responsible for executing safe maneuver
- Maintain passing speed until clear
- Return to proper lane promptly but not abruptly
- In narrow sections, wait for wider area to pass

### Head-On Approaches

When approaching another boat coming in the opposite direction:

1. Both boats should already be on their respective starboard sides
2. Maintain your course and speed
3. Pass port-to-port (each boat's port side faces the other boat)
4. Allow adequate space between boats

**Key Points:**
- If a collision course seems possible, both boats should move farther starboard
- If one boat is out of position, they should correct immediately
- Call out "Hold your course!" if you're correctly positioned and the other boat seems unsure

### Handling Multiple Boats

With three or more boats converging:

1. Maintain starboard positioning
2. Yield to boats being overtaken
3. Communicate clearly with all boats
4. Reduce speed if necessary for safety
5. Consider stopping if situation becomes complex

## Special Navigation Areas

### Bridge Passages

Bridges require special attention due to restricted space and visibility:

1. Identify and use designated arches for rowing traffic
2. NO PASSING under bridges
3. Approach in single file
4. Call out "Taking arch!" as you approach
5. Maintain straight line through the arch
6. Resume normal traffic pattern after clearing bridge

<div class="info-box warning mb-3">
  <h4>Bridge Safety</h4>
  <p>Always emphasize to participants that bridge navigation requires complete focus. The no-passing rule under bridges is absolute and should be strictly enforced during Learn to Scull programs.</p>
</div>

### Narrow Channels

For sections where the waterway narrows:

1. Increase awareness through frequent checking
2. Reduce speed if necessary
3. Maintain strict starboard positioning
4. No passing in very narrow sections
5. Consider using verbal signals: "Ahead!" to alert oncoming boats

### Blind Corners

When approaching a bend with limited visibility:

1. Stay especially close to the starboard shore
2. Reduce speed slightly on approach
3. Increase looking frequency before and during the turn
4. Call out "Corner!" if approaching to alert others
5. Listen for responses from around the bend

## Communication While Rowing

### Verbal Communication

Clear communication prevents collisions. Standard calls include:

- **"Ahead!"** - Alert to presence when approaching head-on
- **"Passing on your port!"** - Overtaking another boat
- **"Hold your course!"** - Instruction to maintain direction
- **"Stop!"** - Emergency stop needed
- **"Look out!"** - Immediate collision danger

**Key Points:**
- Use loud, clear voice projections
- Keep communications brief and direct
- Speak early enough to allow response time
- Acknowledge calls with "Heard!" or clear action

### Visual Signals

When verbal communication is difficult:

- **Raised hand:** Stop/attention needed
- **Pointing arm:** Direction indication
- **Arm waved overhead:** Emergency/distress
- **Paddle raised vertically:** Position marker/attention signal

### Coach Signals

Coaches may use standardized signals from launch:

- **One whistle blast:** Attention/stop rowing
- **Multiple whistle blasts:** Emergency/immediate action
- **Megaphone commands:** Follow explicitly
- **Hand signals:** Direction, stop, proceed, return to dock

## Special Traffic Situations

### Shared Waterways

When sharing water with non-rowing vessels:

- **Powerboats:** They should yield to human-powered craft but don't assume they will
- **Sailboats:** Have right-of-way over powered vessels; give them wide berth
- **Kayaks/Canoes:** Follow same basic rules; may not know rowing traffic patterns
- **Fishing Boats:** Pass at distance to avoid lines; they may be anchored
- **Commercial Traffic:** Always yields to commercial vessels; they have limited maneuverability

### Low Visibility Conditions

During fog, heavy rain, or dawn/dusk:

1. Stay closer to shore than normal
2. Reduce speed significantly
3. Increase verbal communication frequency
4. Consider using lights if visibility is poor
5. Row in pairs/groups rather than singles when possible

## Emergency Navigation

### Collision Avoidance

If collision appears imminent:

1. Call out "STOP!" loudly and clearly
2. Check both oars to stop boat quickly
3. If necessary, back paddle to increase stopping distance
4. Turn boat (if possible) to minimize impact angle
5. Protect your body by bracing away from impact point

### When Out of Position

If you find yourself on the wrong side or out of position:

1. Check carefully in all directions
2. Cross to correct side at perpendicular angle when clear
3. Increase speed slightly to minimize time out of position
4. Signal your intentions clearly to nearby boats
5. Resume normal pattern immediately upon reaching correct side

### Debris or Hazards

When encountering obstacles in the water:

1. Alert nearby boats: "Debris ahead!"
2. Maintain course if possible, allowing adequate clearance
3. If course change needed, move gradually and predictably
4. Return to traffic pattern as soon as safely possible
5. Report significant hazards to coaches/boathouse

## Learning Activities for Novice Scullers

### Traffic Pattern Familiarization

**On-Land Exercises:**
1. **Map Walkthrough:** Trace the pattern on a laminated map
2. **Scenario Discussion:** "What would you do if..." situations
3. **Landmark Association:** Connect shoreline features to position

**On-Water Progression:**
1. **Follow-the-Leader:** Trail coach or experienced sculler
2. **Guided Tour:** Initial row with frequent stopping to orient
3. **Boundary Marking:** Row outward boundaries of permitted areas
4. **Position Checks:** Regular verification of proper lane positioning

### Navigation Skills Development

**Key Skills to Practice:**
1. **Looking Technique:** Over alternating shoulders while maintaining rowing
2. **Position Awareness:** Regular checks against landmarks
3. **Course Maintenance:** Rowing toward fixed points
4. **Traffic Identification:** Spotting and categorizing other vessels
5. **Communication Practice:** Using standard calls in controlled setting

## Quick Reference: Navigation Rules Summary

1. **Stay to starboard** (right side relative to your direction)
2. **Look over your shoulder every 5 strokes**
3. **Pass other boats to their port side**
4. **Call your intentions** when approaching others
5. **No passing under bridges**
6. **Yield to racing shells** during events
7. **Give way to larger vessels** (commercial traffic)
8. **Maintain awareness** at all times
9. **Follow coach instructions** immediately
10. **When in doubt, stop and reassess**

## Questions and Problem-Solving Guide

| Situation | Correct Action |
|-----------|----------------|
| **You're unsure of your position** | Stop, look around for landmarks, proceed cautiously to starboard shore |
| **You notice you're on wrong side** | Check for traffic, cross perpendicularly when clear, resume correct pattern |
| **Approaching boat not following rules** | Move further starboard, call out your position, be prepared to stop |
| **Multiple boats converging** | Maintain position, reduce speed, communicate clearly with all boats |
| **You need to stop on the water** | Move to shore lane, stop parallel to shore, be visible to other traffic |
| **Poor visibility develops while rowing** | Proceed cautiously to nearest safe exit point, or return to dock |
| **Powerboat creating large wake** | Position boat at 45° angle to wake, pause rowing, resume after wake passes |
