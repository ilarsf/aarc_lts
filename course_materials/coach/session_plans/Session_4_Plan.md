## Session Schedule

| Activity | Time | Key Focus/Objective | Relevant Kraft's Key/BBS | Coaching Cues | Safety Notes |
|----------|------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Review Day 3 / Q&A / Day 4 Plan | 15 min | Reinforce leg drive, navigation rules. Outline Day 4: applying skills upriver, bridge pattern, group division | Steering | "Today is about putting it all together. Remember traffic rules!" | Reiterate bridge pattern (specific arch, no passing) |
| Equipment Prep & Launching | 20 min | Standard procedure | N/A | "Double check steering points" | Ensure all boats are properly signed out |
| On-Water Warm-up & Group Division | 25 min | Short row near boathouse, assess rower control/confidence. Divide into groups (Bridge Ready / Skills Development) | N/A | "Show me good steering," "Maintain spacing" | Clear communication about group assignments. Stay with assigned coach/group. |
| On-Water Session 1 (Group Specific) | 50 min | **Group 1 (Bridge):** Guided row upriver, practice bridge passage. **Group 2 (Skills):** Continuous rowing, focus on consistency, steering, drills as needed. | Steering, Sequencing, Push | *G1:* "Eyes up, check clearance," "Hold course through arch." *G2:* "Consistent rhythm," "Look around!" | *G1:* Coach leads, strict adherence to bridge pattern, maintain spacing. *G2:* Coach monitors, keeps group cohesive, reinforces general traffic rules |
| Mid-Session Rally / Shore Break (Optional) | 10 min | Briefly bring groups together or provide individual feedback, check in, hydration | N/A | "How was navigating the bridges/maintaining course?" | Assess fatigue, conditions |
| On-Water Session 2 | 45 min | Continued rowing, potentially swapping focus, skills consolidation | All | "Smooth recovery," "Push connects," "Maintain awareness" | Coaches maintain vigilance, ensure groups remain separated if necessary, manage return to dock timing |
| Flip Test Re-takes (if needed) | (Concurrent/ End) | Allow previously unsuccessful rowers another attempt at flip test | Relaxation | "Remember: calm, kick, pull low" | Coach supervision, near dock, PFD if required |
| Landing & Post-Rowing Maintenance | 15 min | Standard landing, equipment cleaning, storage | N/A | "Thorough wipe down," "Report issues" | Efficient dock clearing |
| Final Wrap-up / Next Steps / Q&A | 10 min | Review program, Q&A, discuss pathways after LTS, administer checklist feedback | N/A | "Congratulations! Here's what you can do next..." | N/A |

  <h4>Coaching Tips</h4>
  <p>The skill-based division for this session is important but can be sensitive. Frame it positively: "Group 1 will focus on bridge navigation while Group 2 will work on refining technique." Emphasize that both paths lead to the same goal of competent sculling.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-box warning mb-3">
  <h4>Safety Note</h4>
  <p>By this final session, most participants are eager to explore and may push their limits. Maintain clear boundaries about where they should row, and ensure coaches can effectively supervise all participants even when groups are separated.</p>

## Detailed Drill Explanations

### Continuous Rowing with Navigation Focus
- **Execution:** Not a specific 'drill' but the primary activity. Rowers practice maintaining stroke rhythm, sequencing, and power application while actively steering, monitoring position, looking over shoulders frequently.
- **Purpose:** Integrates all learned skills in a practical, dynamic setting. Tests ability to multitask – row effectively *and* navigate safely.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Remind rowers to systematically scan their surroundings, anticipate turns and obstacles, maintain consistent rhythm even when focusing on navigation.

### Bridge Passage Practice (Group 1)
- **Execution:** Guided practice rowing through designated bridge arches, focusing on maintaining straight course, judging clearance, adhering to "no passing" rule.
- **Purpose:** Builds confidence in navigating a common and potentially hazardous river feature. Directly addresses safety and traffic pattern knowledge.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Approach bridges with decisive, steady pressure. Keep eyes up to judge clearance. Maintain current line through the arch without zigzagging.

### Skill Refinement Stations (Group 2)
- **Execution:** Rotate through focused practice stations:
  1. Balance and Relaxation: Square blade rowing at light pressure
  2. Technical Precision: Pause drills to reinforce sequencing
  3. Turning Practice: Pivot turns and course changes
- **Purpose:** Addresses specific skill gaps identified in earlier sessions.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Focus on quality of movement rather than quantity. Allow adequate practice time at each station.

## Common Beginner Errors & Corrective Cues

### Navigation
- **Error:** Fixating on boat directly ahead instead of looking further upriver for navigation points.
  - **Cue:** "Look past the boat in front, pick your own point far ahead." "Scan the river."
- **Error:** Failing to stay consistently on correct (starboard) side of river, especially around bends.
  - **Cue:** "Anticipate the turn, start moving over early." "Hug the starboard bank (safely)."
  - **Coach Intervention:** Use whistle or megaphone to redirect immediately.
- **Error:** Stopping rowing completely to look around, losing momentum and position.
  - **Cue:** "Quick glances over alternating shoulders *while* driving." "Keep the boat moving."

### Integration
- **Error:** Technique deterioration when focusing on steering or navigating.
  - **Cue:** "Find a rhythm, let the steering become part of the stroke." "One thought at a time: Push, then check, then recover."
- **Error:** Inconsistent effort or loss of focus during longer rowing pieces.
  - **Cue:** "Maintain steady pressure." "Stay focused on your technique points."

### Bridge Passage (Group 1)
- **Error:** Hesitation or erratic steering when approaching/passing through arch.
  - **Cue:** "Commit to your line." "Keep rowing smoothly through." "Small corrections only."
- **Error:** Getting too close to bridge abutments.
  - **Cue:** "Aim for the center of the arch." "Give yourself space."
