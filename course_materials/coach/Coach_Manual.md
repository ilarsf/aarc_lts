  - Square blade rowing practice
  - Introduction to recovery phase
  - Independent boat entry/exit

### Session 3: Developing Technique
- **Goals**: Improve coordination, introduce feathering
- **Key Activities**:
  - Technical drills (pause drills, arms-only)
  - Feathering technique introduction
  - Sculling with square blades, progressing to feathered
  - Basic steering concepts

### Session 4: Refining Skills
- **Goals**: Blade control, steering, lengthening the stroke
- **Key Activities**:
  - Square/feather coordination drills
  - Steering exercises
  - Full-slide rowing with attention to sequencing
  - Introduction to power application

### Session 5: Building Endurance and Confidence
- **Goals**: Extended rowing, developing rhythm
- **Key Activities**:
  - Longer continuous rowing periods
  - Rate and pressure variations
  - Group formation rowing (following experienced sculler)
  - Troubleshooting common issues

### Session 6: Integration and Next Steps
- **Goals**: Independent sculling, preparation for continued practice
- **Key Activities**:
  - Review of all techniques
  - Independent launching, rowing, and recovery
  - Safety protocols review
  - Introduction to club rowing options
  - Graduation celebration

## Technical Teaching Points

### The KRAFT Sculling Method
- **K**: Keep shoulders relaxed and down
- **R**: Reach from hips, not shoulders
- **A**: Arms straight until legs are flat
- **F**: Feather after extraction
- **T**: Tap down before extraction

### Critical Safety Skills
- **Flip test protocol**: Step-by-step procedure for teaching capsizing recovery
- **Equipment checks**: Pre-row checklist for boat integrity
- **Weather assessment**: Guidelines for safe rowing conditions
- **Emergency procedures**: Communication protocols and rescue techniques

### Common Technical Issues and Corrections
| Issue | Probable Cause | Correction |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Rushing the slide | Anxiety, poor sequencing | Pause drills, counting rhythm |
| Skying blades | Hand position too low | Focus on flat wrists, proper grip |
| Boat wobble | Weight distribution, timing | Core engagement drills, balance exercises |
| Digging blades | Too much downward force | Emphasize horizontal movement, light hands |
| Catches missed | Poor timing, preparation | Pause at catch, slow-motion drills |

## Class Management

### Pre-Session Preparation
- Arrive 30 minutes before class
- Check all equipment and facilities
- Review session plan and individualize for returning students
- Set up demonstration equipment on land
- Check weather conditions and water safety

### During-Session Management
- Begin with land-based review (10-15 minutes)
- Demonstrate key focus points for the day
- Individual check-ins while on water
- Use clear, consistent terminology
- Provide frequent positive reinforcement
- Document student progress

### Post-Session Wrap-Up
- Supervise proper equipment storage
- Conduct brief feedback session
- Preview next session goals
- Complete session notes for each participant
- Send follow-up email with session highlights and preparation for next class

## Coaching Tips
- Focus on one major technical point per session
- Use analogies and imagery to communicate concepts
- Incorporate video analysis when possible
- Adapt teaching style to different learning modalities
- Balance technical instruction with enjoyment of the sport
- Create a supportive environment that builds confidence
