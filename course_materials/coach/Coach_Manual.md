    <h3>Core Concepts: Key Technical Frameworks</h3>
    <p>Throughout all sessions, continuously reinforce these essential frameworks:</p>
    
    <h4 id="krafts-keys">Kraft's Keys</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>K</strong>: Keep shoulders relaxed and down</li>
      <li><strong>R</strong>: Reach from hips, not shoulders</li>
      <li><strong>A</strong>: Arms straight until legs are flat</li>
      <li><strong>F</strong>: Feather after extraction</li>
      <li><strong>T</strong>: Tap down before extraction</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 id="black-bear-sequence">Black Bear Sequence</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grip and feather:</strong> Maintain proper hand position and blade control</li>
      <li><strong>Release:</strong> Clean exit with light tap down</li>
      <li><strong>Recovery/Catch:</strong> Sequenced return (arms → body → slide) to a prepared catch position</li>
      <li><strong>Drive:</strong> Connected power application (legs → back → arms)</li>
      <li><strong>Steering:</strong> Frequent looks with subtle corrections</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Help learners understand these concepts by directing them to the <a href="../learner/QA_Companion.html#resources-tab">Technical Frameworks</a> reference guide and the embedded video demonstrations.</p>

    <h4>Detailed Drill Explanations (Day 1)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Erg - Pick Drill:</strong> This drill isolates the finish sequence. Starting from the finish position (legs flat, body leaned back slightly, arms drawn in), the rower practices: 1) Arms away only, 2) Arms and body pivot forward, 3) Adding partial slide segments, building towards the full stroke.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Purpose:</em> Teaches the correct sequence of movements for the recovery (arms, body, slide), emphasizing a clean release, proper hand levels away from the body, and maintaining good posture before the slide begins. Links directly to Kraft's Key: <em>Sequencing</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Erg - Reverse Pick Drill:</strong> This drill builds the stroke from the catch position. Starting at the catch (shins vertical, body forward, arms extended), the rower practices: 1) Legs only drive (keeping arms straight and body angle constant), 2) Legs and back swing (opening the body angle after the initial leg push), 3) Full stroke (adding the arm draw).
        <ul>
          <li><em>Purpose:</em> Establishes the fundamental concept of initiating the drive with the powerful leg muscles, preventing premature back swing ('bum shoving') or pulling with the arms. It teaches the feeling of "hanging" off the handle and connecting the leg drive effectively. Links directly to Kraft's Key: <em>Sequencing</em>, <em>Application of pressure</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Dockside - Ghost Strokes:</strong> While sitting in the boat at the dock (with coach stabilizing), the rower practices minimal, light strokes, focusing on handle movement, feathering (turning blades parallel to water) and squaring (turning blades perpendicular), and feeling how oar movements affect boat stability.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Purpose:</em> Builds initial confidence and understanding of basic oar control and its impact on the boat in a safe, controlled environment before attempting open water rowing. Links to Kraft's Keys: <em>Correct Grip</em>, <em>Everything is horizontal</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Common Beginner Errors & Corrective Cues (Day 1)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Erg:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Gripping handles too tightly. <em>Cue:</em> "Relax fingers, think 'hooks,' not fists." "Imagine holding a baby bird – firm but gentle."</li>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Breaking arms early during the drive. <em>Cue:</em> "Legs push first, keep arms straight like ropes." (Use Reverse Pick Drill).</li>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Slouching posture (rounded back). <em>Cue:</em> "Sit tall from the hips, core engaged, proud chest."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Boat Handling:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Incorrect carry grip (hands on hull). <em>Cue:</em> "Hands on gunwales or carry on shoulders for singles."</li>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Bumping riggers against racks/other boats. <em>Cue:</em> "Watch your riggers! Communicate with partner."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Getting In/Out:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Rushing, standing up too quickly, losing balance. <em>Cue:</em> "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast," "Keep weight low and centered," "One hand on dock, one on boat handle/gunwale."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Flip Test:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Panicking in water. <em>Cue:</em> "Breathe. Stay calm. The boat and oars float. Hold onto the boat."</li>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Difficulty re-entering (pulling boat over). <em>Cue:</em> "Keep body low in water," "Use strong leg kick," "Pull across, not down." (Coach provides physical guidance).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

    <h4>Detailed Drill Explanations (Day 2)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pick Drill (Water):</strong> Mirrors the erg drill but performed in the boat. Start with arms-only rowing from the finish, progress to arms-and-body rowing, then add half-slide, and finally full-slide rowing.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Purpose:</em> To transfer the learned recovery sequence (arms → body → slide) from the stable erg to the unstable boat, building confidence and control incrementally. Reinforces Kraft's Keys: <em>Sequencing</em>, <em>Relaxation</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Pause Drills (Arms Away, Body Over):</strong> Rowers execute the stroke normally but insert a distinct pause (approx. 2 seconds) at specific points during the recovery. Common pauses for Day 2 include:
        <ul>
          <li><em>Arms Away Pause:</em> Pause immediately after the release, once hands have cleared the knees. Focus on quick hand movement away and maintaining posture.</li>
          <li><em>Body Over Pause:</em> Pause after arms are extended and the body has pivoted forward from the hips, before the knees begin to bend. Focus on achieving forward body angle early.</li>
          <li><em>Purpose:</em> To enhance body awareness and control during the recovery. These drills explicitly teach the correct sequence, preventing common errors like early knee bend. They improve timing within the crew (even in singles, it improves consistency) and allow for a mental "reset". Links to Kraft's Keys: <em>Sequencing</em>, <em>Relaxation</em>, <em>Body forward</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Basic Turning (One Arm):</strong> While moving, the rower takes gentle strokes with the oar on the <em>outside</em> of the desired turn, while the oar on the <em>inside</em> of the turn trails in the water or takes very light strokes/holds water slightly.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Purpose:</em> To teach fundamental boat control, allowing the rower to change direction safely and effectively.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Common Beginner Errors & Corrective Cues (Day 2)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sequencing:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Bending knees before hands are away/body is over. <em>Cue:</em> "Hands away FIRST," "Body pivots, THEN knees bend," (Use Pause Drills).</li>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Rushing the slide (moving too quickly towards the stern). <em>Cue:</em> "Slow the slide, feel the boat glide," "Control the speed," (Use Pause Drills).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Balance:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Tensing up, high shoulders, gripping oars tightly. <em>Cue:</em> "Relax shoulders down," "Breathe," "Light grip, let the oarlocks work."</li>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Uneven hand heights causing boat tilt. <em>Cue:</em> "Keep hands level on recovery," "Left hand slightly above right during crossover." Link to Kraft's Key: <em>Everything is horizontal</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Turning:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Pulling too hard with the turning oar, causing jerky movements. <em>Cue:</em> "Gentle, steady pressure," "Look where you want to go."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Blade Work:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Catching crabs (oar gets stuck underwater). Often due to poor timing, incorrect blade angle, or hitting waves incorrectly. <em>Cue:</em> "Focus on smooth sequence," "Square the blade just before entry," "Tap down cleanly at the finish."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Detailed Drill Explanations (Day 3)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reverse Pick Drill (Water):</strong> Start with legs-only strokes (maintaining forward body lean and straight arms), progress to legs-and-back swing, then full strokes.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Purpose:</em> To isolate and emphasize the leg drive as the primary power source in the boat. It teaches rowers to connect effectively at the catch and "hang" their body weight off the handles, transferring leg power efficiently rather than pulling prematurely with the arms or back. Links to Kraft's Keys: <em>Sequencing</em> (drive phase), <em>Application of pressure</em>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Pivot Turns (One Backing/One Rowing):</strong> To execute a sharp turn (e.g., 180 degrees), the rower gently backs water with one oar (pushing the handle away, blade feathered or slightly squared to resist) while taking light, arms-only or arms-and-body forward strokes with the other oar.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Purpose:</em> An essential skill for maneuvering in confined spaces, such as turning around buoys, approaching docks, or avoiding obstacles quickly. Provides much tighter turning radius than one-armed rowing turns.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Common Beginner Errors & Corrective Cues (Day 3)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drive:</strong>
        <ul>

    <h4>Detailed Drill Explanations (Day 4)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Continuous Rowing with Navigation Focus:</strong> This isn't a specific 'drill' but the primary activity. Rowers practice maintaining stroke rhythm, sequencing, and power application while actively steering, monitoring their position relative to the traffic pattern (starboard side), looking over their shoulder frequently, and anticipating turns or obstacles.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Purpose:</em> To integrate all learned skills in a practical, dynamic setting. It tests the rower's ability to multitask – row effectively <em>and</em> navigate safely. Links to all Kraft's Keys and Black Bear Sequence elements.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Bridge Passage Practice (Group 1):</strong> Guided practice rowing through designated bridge arches, focusing on maintaining a straight course, judging clearance, and adhering strictly to the "no passing" rule.
        <ul>
          <li><em>Purpose:</em> To build confidence and competence in navigating a common and potentially hazardous river feature. Directly addresses safety and traffic pattern knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Common Beginner Errors & Corrective Cues (Day 4)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Navigation:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Fixating on boat directly ahead instead of looking further upriver for navigation points or traffic. <em>Cue:</em> "Look past the boat in front, pick your own point far ahead," "Scan the river."</li>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Failing to stay consistently on the correct (starboard) side of the river, especially around bends. <em>Cue:</em> "Anticipate the turn, start moving over early," "Hug the starboard bank (safely)." <em>Coach Intervention:</em> Use whistle or megaphone to redirect immediately.</li>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Stopping rowing completely to look around, losing momentum and position. <em>Cue:</em> "Quick glances over alternating shoulders <em>while</em> driving," "Keep the boat moving."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Integration:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Technique deterioration (e.g., poor sequencing, rushing) when focusing on steering or navigating. <em>Cue:</em> "Find a rhythm, let the steering become part of the stroke," "One thought at a time: Push, then check, then recover."</li>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Inconsistent effort or loss of focus during longer rowing pieces. <em>Cue:</em> "Maintain steady pressure," "Stay focused on your technique points," (Provide specific reminders related to earlier drills).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Bridge Passage (Group 1):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Hesitation or erratic steering when approaching/passing through the arch. <em>Cue:</em> "Commit to your line," "Keep rowing smoothly through," "Small corrections only."</li>
          <li><em>Error:</em> Getting too close to bridge abutments. <em>Cue:</em> "Aim for the center of the arch," "Give yourself space."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The KRAFT Sculling Method</h3>
    <p>Use these five key principles as a framework for teaching and correcting technique. Consistently reinforce these concepts throughout all sessions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>K</strong>: Keep shoulders relaxed and down</li>
      <li><strong>R</strong>: Reach from hips, not shoulders</li>
      <li><strong>A</strong>: Arms straight until legs are flat</li>
      <li><strong>F</strong>: Feather after extraction</li>
      <li><strong>T</strong>: Tap down before extraction</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Black Bear Sequence</h3>
    <p>This sequence provides a systematic approach to teaching the components of the stroke in a logical order.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grip and feather:</strong> Correct hand position and control of the blade angle</li>
      <li><strong>Release:</strong> Clean exit with light tap down at the finish</li>
      <li><strong>Recovery/Catch:</strong> Sequenced return to the catch position (arms → body → slide)</li>
      <li><strong>Drive:</strong> Connected power application (legs → back → arms)</li>
      <li><strong>Steering:</strong> Regular checking of direction with subtle course corrections</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Critical Safety Skills</h3>
    <div class="info-box">

    <h3>Key Drills for Technique Development</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pick Drill:</strong> Builds the recovery sequence from finish to catch
        <ul>
          <li>Start at the finish position</li>
          <li>Progress through: arms only → arms and body → arms, body, partial slide → full stroke</li>
          <li>Focuses on clean release and proper sequencing away from the finish</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Reverse Pick Drill:</strong> Builds the drive sequence from catch to finish
        <ul>
          <li>Start at the catch position</li>
          <li>Progress through: legs only → legs and back → full stroke</li>

          <li>Simplifies technique for beginners</li>
          <li>Improves feel for proper blade depth</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Ghost Strokes:</strong> Minimal-pressure strokes at the dock or in shallow water
        <ul>
          <li>Focuses on handle movement and blade work</li>
          <li>Builds confidence in a stable environment</li>

    <h3>Hand Care Guide for Rowers: Blister Prevention and Treatment</h3>
    
    <h4>Prevention Strategies</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proper Grip Technique:</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li>Maintain a relaxed "hook" grip rather than a tight "death grip"</li>
          <li>Let the oar handle sit in the fingers with light pressure</li>
          <li>Relax the wrists and allow the oarlocks to do the work</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Gradual Conditioning:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase rowing duration incrementally to allow skin adaptation</li>
          <li>Allow calluses to form gradually as natural protection</li>
          <li>Start with shorter sessions and build up time on the water</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Proactive Protection:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>For known "hot spots," athletic tape can be applied preventatively</li>
          <li>Tape must be applied to clean, dry hands at least 20 minutes before rowing</li>
          <li>Keep oar handles clean and free of rough spots or damage</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Callus Management:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Regularly smooth thick calluses with a file or pumice stone after softening</li>
          <li>Maintain calluses at moderate thickness - not too thick or too thin</li>
          <li>Moisturize hands regularly, especially at night, to keep skin supple</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Blister Treatment</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>For Intact Blisters:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Leave small blisters intact if possible - the skin provides natural protection</li>
          <li>Cover with a hydrocolloid blister dressing or athletic tape with non-stick pad underneath</li>
          <li>For large, painful blisters that will likely break, consider controlled draining under clean conditions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>For Popped/Torn Blisters:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Clean the area gently with mild soap and water</li>
          <li>If a skin flap is present, leave it in place as it provides temporary protection</li>
          <li>Apply antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly</li>
          <li>Cover with a non-stick dressing and tape securely</li>
          <li>Change dressing daily or if it becomes wet/soiled</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Warning Signs of Infection:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Increasing pain, redness spreading beyond the blister area</li>
          <li>Warmth, swelling, or pus formation</li>
          <li>Red streaks leading from the area or fever</li>
          <li>If signs of infection appear, seek medical attention promptly</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Rowing with Blisters</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Taping Techniques:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Always place a non-stick barrier directly over the wound before taping</li>
          <li>For palm blisters, the "tape grip" method provides protection without adhesive on the affected area</li>
          <li>Apply tape to clean, dry skin and ensure smooth edges to prevent rolling</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Glove Considerations:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Can provide immediate protection for multiple blisters</li>
          <li>Look for rowing-specific gloves with appropriate padding</li>
          <li>Ensure proper fit to prevent creating new friction points</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Post-Rowing Care:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Remove tape and dressings after rowing to allow cleaning and air exposure</li>
          <li>Wash hands thoroughly to prevent infection</li>
          <li>Re-assess blister condition and apply fresh dressing if needed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
