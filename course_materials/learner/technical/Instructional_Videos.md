  <p><strong>Rowing Skills: Circles (Sculling Drill)</strong> – <strong>British Rowing</strong> – <strong>1:47</strong></p>
  <p><em>Overview:</em> This drill-focused video (part of British Rowing's skill series) introduces <strong>"circle" drills</strong> to improve your balance and blade control in a single. Coach Ellie Hizzett explains and demonstrates how to do the circles drill: rowing with one oar only (feathering it continuously in a circular motion) while the other oar balances the boat. This forces the sculler to fine-tune their balance and handle control. The video shows why the drill helps your rowing ability – by isolating each side, you learn to keep the boat set (level) and develop a light touch on the handles. Practicing this and similar stability drills will rapidly build your confidence in the single scull's balance.</p>
</div>

  <p><strong>Sculling Drills</strong> – <strong>USRowing</strong> – <strong>5:00</strong></p>
  <p><em>Overview:</em> A compilation of fundamental on-water drills led by a USRowing coach to reinforce proper technique at each part of the stroke. It includes drills like the <strong>pause drill</strong> (pausing at various positions like arms-only, body-over) to focus on timing, the <strong>pick drill</strong> (building the stroke in segments from arms-only up to full slide) to sharpen sequencing, and exercises such as <strong>tap-tap release</strong> for improving blade releases or <strong>feathering drills</strong> for handle control. Each drill is demonstrated and explained with the specific technical focus (e.g. pausing at half slide to eliminate rushing). By incorporating these drills into practice, scullers can isolate and improve individual stroke components – catch placement, stroke rate control, finish technique – in a structured way. It's essentially a toolbox of coaching exercises to help you polish your technique piece by piece.</p>

  <p><strong>How to Steer Your Scull</strong> – <strong>Calm Waters Rowing (USA)</strong> – <strong>2:00</strong></p>
  <p><em>Overview:</em> In this quick tip video, a rowing coach explains techniques for steering a coxless single. Unlike larger boats, your single doesn't have a rudder or coxswain to guide it, so this tutorial shows how <em>you</em> can make directional adjustments. It covers using pressure differences – e.g. applying a bit more push with one oar than the other – as well as subtle body weight shifts to turn the boat. You'll also learn how to look over your shoulder safely to check your course (maintaining balance while glancing around). These expert steering tips are crucial for scullers, especially on rivers with other traffic, and will help you confidently navigate your single without losing balance or technique.</p>

  <p><strong>Sculling Basics</strong> – <strong>USRowing</strong> – <strong>14:55</strong></p>
  <p><em>Overview:</em> A longer, <strong>comprehensive</strong> coaching video from USRowing that not only teaches the fundamentals of the stroke but also points out typical novice mistakes and how to fix them. It is structured as an all-in-one technique session: a coach goes through the stroke step by step, and at each step highlights pitfalls new scullers often face – for example, rushing the slide on recovery, shooting the tail (legs driving with no body swing), dipping the hands at the catch, or letting the blade depth fluctuate. For each error, the correct technique is shown and drills or cues to correct it are suggested. Because it "covers all the elements of the sculling stroke" in detail, this video effectively serves as a troubleshooting guide. As a viewer, you can compare your own rowing to the demonstrations to identify any of these common errors, and then follow the provided advice to continually improve your form.</p>

  <p><strong>How to Launch Your Rowing Boat & Do Your First Strokes</strong> – <strong>Liteboat TV</strong> – <strong>6:53</strong></p>
  <p><em>Overview:</em> A beginner-friendly guide that walks you through an entire first outing, produced in collaboration with TopRow (a recreational rowing program). The video starts with how to carry and launch your single scull from the dock, then moves into what a first practice session might look like on the water. Coaches demonstrate initial drills like simply sitting at different positions to get your balance, then taking your <em>very first strokes</em> on the water with half slide rowing. They provide a simple structure: warm-up with stationary drills, then focus on one technique element at a time (for example, arms-only rowing, then adding body swing, then legs). The pacing is tailored for novices – you're encouraged to pause, regain balance, and not rush as you build coordination. By following this session outline, new scullers (and their coaches) can structure the first few practices methodically, ensuring a safe and confidence-building progression in the single. It's essentially a template for Day 1 on-water that you can replicate and gradually expand upon as you gain skill.</p>
