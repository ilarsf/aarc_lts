# Common Rowing Fixes for Beginners

This guide covers common technical issues you might experience as a new rower and simple ways to fix them. Use these tips to improve your technique and make your rowing more comfortable and efficient.

## Recovery Issues (Getting Back to the Catch)

### Rushing Forward

**Signs You're Doing This:**
- You slide quickly to the catch position
- Your movements feel jerky
- The boat wobbles or slows down between strokes

**How to Fix It:**
- Think: "Slow the slide, feel the boat glide"
- Move your hands away from your body first
- Then pivot your body forward
- Only then bend your knees to slide forward
- Try counting "one-two-three-four" during the recovery to control your speed

### Blades Too High (Skying)

**Signs You're Doing This:**
- Your blades are high above the water during recovery
- Your blade might dive deeply or miss the water at the catch
- You feel unstable or tippy

**How to Fix It:**
- Think: "Level hands like carrying a tray of drinks"
- Keep your hands at a consistent height during recovery
- Maintain your wrists flat, not flexed
- Practice rowing with square blades (no feathering) to build awareness

### Knees Rising Too Early

**Signs You're Doing This:**
- Your knees start to bend before your arms are extended
- You feel cramped at the front of the stroke
- You can't reach as far forward as you should

**How to Fix It:**
- Think: "Hands away FIRST, body pivot SECOND, then slide"
- Make sure your hands clear your knees before your knees bend
- Practice pausing with your arms extended and body pivoted forward before sliding
- Focus on the sequence: arms → body → slide

## Drive Issues (Applying Power)

### Bending Arms Too Early

**Signs You're Doing This:**
- Your arms bend before your legs are pushed down
- Your shoulders might hunch during the drive
- You feel arm and back fatigue quickly

**How to Fix It:**
- Think: "Push with legs first, arms are just hooks"
- Keep your arms straight until your legs are almost extended
- Focus on pressing through your feet to move the boat
- Imagine your arms as ropes - they don't actively pull until later

### Opening Back Too Early

**Signs You're Doing This:**
- Your seat moves back before your shoulders/handle move
- Your back opens early in the drive
- You might feel strain in your lower back

**How to Fix It:**
- Think: "Maintain forward body angle during initial leg push"
- Keep your body angle constant until legs are halfway down
- Imagine "hanging" your weight off the handle through straight arms
- Practice rowing with legs only while maintaining your forward body angle

### Weak Leg Drive

**Signs You're Doing This:**
- You rely mostly on your arms and back for power
- The boat doesn't accelerate well
- You feel tired quickly, especially in arms and shoulders

**How to Fix It:**
- Think: "Push the foot stretchers away from you"
- Focus on feeling pressure under your feet
- Imagine pushing a car or doing a leg press at the gym
- Remember the power sequence: legs → back → arms

## Balance and Stability Issues

### Boat Wobble

**Signs You're Doing This:**
- The boat rocks side to side
- You feel tense trying to balance
- You have a death grip on the handles

**How to Fix It:**
- Think: "Relax shoulders down, breathe"
- Use a light grip on the handles - just hooks, not fists
- Keep your core engaged but upper body relaxed
- Balanced hands lead to a balanced boat

### Blade Depth Problems

**Signs You're Doing This:**
- Either digging too deep (oars buried too far)
- Or washing out (blades not fully covered)
- Splashing at catch or finish

**How to Fix It:**
- For digging: "Press out, not down"
- For washing out: "Lock onto the water before pushing"
- Focus on consistent hand heights
- Just cover the blade - no more, no less

## Navigation and Steering

### Difficulty Staying on Course

**Signs You're Doing This:**
- Boat weaves from side to side
- You make overcorrections when steering
- Your technique breaks down when you look around

**How to Fix It:**
- Think: "Look every 5 strokes – quick checks"
- Pick a distant point to aim for
- Make small, gentle steering corrections
- Practice looking over your shoulder without stopping your rowing

### Traffic Pattern Problems

**Signs You're Doing This:**
- You're on the wrong side of the waterway
- You cut corners on turns
- You're unsure where you should be on the river

**How to Fix It:**
- Think: "Stay to the right (starboard) side of the waterway"
- Follow more experienced rowers
- Use landmarks to help remember traffic patterns
- When in doubt, move further to the right

## Putting It All Together

The biggest challenge for new rowers is maintaining good technique while also navigating and steering. Don't get frustrated if you can't do everything at once! Focus on one skill at a time, and gradually combine them as each becomes more natural.

**Remember:** Every rower starts as a beginner. Improvement comes with practice and patience. Focus on one correction at a time rather than trying to fix everything at once.
