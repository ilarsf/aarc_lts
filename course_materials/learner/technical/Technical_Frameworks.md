# Sculling Technical Frameworks

<div class="info-box note">
  <h4>Understanding the Basics</h4>
  <p>These frameworks will help you learn and remember the key elements of proper sculling technique. Your coaches will refer to these concepts throughout the program.</p>
</div>

## Kraft's Keys: Five Essential Principles

Kraft's Keys is a simple way to remember the most important elements of good sculling technique. The letters in "KRAFT" stand for:

### K: Keep shoulders relaxed and down
- Avoid tension in your shoulders and neck
- Let your shoulders drop away from your ears
- Maintain a natural, relaxed posture
- This helps with balance and prevents fatigue

### R: Reach from hips, not shoulders
- Pivot forward from your hips, not by hunching your shoulders
- Maintain a straight back as you pivot forward
- Think of your torso as a single unit pivoting at the hips
- This enables proper body position at the catch

### A: Arms straight until legs are flat
- Keep your arms extended during the drive phase until your legs are nearly straight
- Let your legs do the work first
- Don't pull with your arms until your legs have applied their power
- This ensures you use the strongest muscles first

### F: Feather after extraction
- Complete the extraction of the blade from the water before rotating the handle
- Clean extraction prevents "washing out" at the finish
- Proper sequencing: pull, tap down, extract, then feather
- This creates a clean finish and sets up the recovery

### T: Tap down before extraction
- Apply a slight downward pressure on the handles at the finish
- This lifts the blades cleanly out of the water
- A light tap is all that's needed
- This prevents dragging the blades at the finish

## The Black Bear Sequence: Building the Rowing Stroke

The Black Bear Sequence breaks down the complete rowing stroke into five manageable components that you'll learn step by step:

### 1. Grip and Feather
- How to hold the oars properly
- Controlling blade angle (feathered/parallel vs. squared/perpendicular)
- Light grip with relaxed fingers
- Proper hand spacing and position

### 2. Release
- The moment when the blade leaves the water at the finish
- Clean extraction with minimal splash
- Quick hands away movement to start the recovery
- Setting up a good recovery position

### 3. Recovery/Catch
- The journey from finish back to catch
- Proper sequence: arms away → body pivot → slide
- Controlled slide speed (slow recovery is good!)
- Preparing for a clean catch

### 4. Drive
- Power phase when blade is in water
- Proper sequence: legs → back → arms
- Connected power application
- Maintaining pressure through the stroke

### 5. Steering
- Looking over your shoulder regularly
- Making small course corrections
- Maintaining awareness of your surroundings
- Anticipating turns and obstacles

## How These Frameworks Help You Learn

Your coaches will use these frameworks to teach you proper technique:

- **Progressive Learning** - You'll focus on one element at a time before putting everything together
- **Clear Feedback** - Coaches can quickly identify which key principle needs adjustment
- **Consistent Language** - Everyone uses the same terminology, making instruction clearer
- **Focus Areas** - When you're feeling overwhelmed, focus on just one key at a time

  <h4>Practice Tip</h4>
  <p>Don't try to focus on all aspects of technique at once. Pick one principle from Kraft's Keys to concentrate on during each practice session, then gradually build up to incorporating all of them naturally.</p>
