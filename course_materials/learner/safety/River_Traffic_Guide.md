      <h3>The "Stay Right" Rule</h3>

The most important rule in rowing traffic is to **stay to the right** side of the waterway (relative to your direction of travel). This is similar to driving a car on the right side of the road.

**Remember:**
- Always keep the nearest shoreline on your right side
- This creates predictable two-way traffic flow
- When in doubt, move further right

      <h3>Looking Around</h3>

      <p>You must actively watch where you're going:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Look over your shoulder every 3-5 strokes</li>
        <li>Alternate between looking left and right</li>
        <li>Check what's ahead of you regularly</li>
        <li>Be aware of other boats around you</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Passing Another Boat</h3>

      <p>When you need to pass a slower boat ahead of you:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Check carefully that the passing lane is clear</li>
        <li>Call out "Passing on your port!" (their left side)</li>
        <li>Move away from shore to pass</li>
        <li>Return to your normal lane once safely past</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Meeting Oncoming Boats</h3>

      <p>When you see a boat coming toward you:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Stay to your right (they should be on their right)</li>
        <li>Pass left-to-left (port-to-port)</li>
        <li>Maintain your course and speed</li>
        <li>Allow plenty of space between boats</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Bridges</h3>

      <p>Bridge navigation requires extra care:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>No passing under bridges - ever!</li>
        <li>Always approach bridges in single file</li>
        <li>Use only the designated arch for rowing</li>
        <li>Stay centered in the arch</li>
        <li>Maintain a straight line through the bridge</li>
        <li>Be aware of the current and wind effects</li>
        <li>Be cautious of powerboats and their wakes</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Narrow Sections</h3>

      <p>In narrow areas of the waterway:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Be extra vigilant - look around more frequently</li>
        <li>Stick close to the right shore</li>
        <li>Reduce your speed if needed</li>
        <li>No passing in very narrow sections</li>
      </ol>

        <h4>Tip for New Rowers</h4>
        <p>It takes practice to look over your shoulder while maintaining good rowing form. Try this: pause at the finish of your stroke, look quickly, then continue rowing. With practice, you'll learn to check without stopping.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box warning">
        <h4>Remember</h4>
        <p>Following traffic patterns isn't just about rules—it's about everyone's safety! When all rowers follow the same patterns, we can predict each other's movements and avoid collisions.</p>
