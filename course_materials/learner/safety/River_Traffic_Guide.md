      <h3>The "Stay Right" Rule</h3>

The most important rule in rowing traffic is to **stay to the right** side of the waterway (relative to your direction of travel). This is similar to driving a car on the right side of the road.

**Remember:**
- Always keep the nearest shoreline on your right side
- This creates predictable two-way traffic flow
- When in doubt, move further right

      <h3>Looking Around</h3>

      <p>You must actively watch where you're going:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Look over your shoulder every 3-5 strokes</li>
        <li>Alternate between looking left and right</li>
        <li>Check what's ahead of you regularly</li>
        <li>Be aware of other boats around you</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Passing Another Boat</h3>

When you need to pass a slower boat ahead of you:

1. Check carefully that the passing lane is clear
2. Call out "Passing on your port!" (their left side)
3. Move away from shore to pass
4. Return to your normal lane once safely past

      <h3>Meeting Oncoming Boats</h3>

      <p>When you see a boat coming toward you:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Stay to your right (they should be on their right)</li>
        <li>Pass left-to-left (port-to-port)</li>
        <li>Maintain your course and speed</li>
        <li>Allow plenty of space between boats</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Bridges</h3>

Bridge navigation requires extra care:

1. No passing under bridges - ever!
2. Approach in single file
3. Use only the designated arch for rowing
4. Stay centered in the arch
5. Maintain a straight line through the bridge

      <h3>Narrow Sections</h3>

      <p>In narrow areas of the waterway:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Be extra vigilant - look around more frequently</li>
        <li>Stick close to the right shore</li>
        <li>Reduce your speed if needed</li>
        <li>No passing in very narrow sections</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Standard Calls</h3>

Learn these important verbal signals:

- **"Ahead!"** - When approaching boats head-on
- **"Passing on your port!"** - When overtaking
- **"Stop!"** - Emergency stop needed
- **"Look out!"** - Immediate danger

      <h3>Coach Signals</h3>

      <p>Pay attention to signals from coaches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One whistle blast = stop rowing</li>
        <li>Multiple whistle blasts = emergency</li>
        <li>Hand signals and megaphone commands</li>
      </ul>

        <h4>Tip for New Rowers</h4>
        <p>It takes practice to look over your shoulder while maintaining good rowing form. Try this: pause at the finish of your stroke, look quickly, then continue rowing. With practice, you'll learn to check without stopping.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-box warning">
        <h4>Remember</h4>
        <p>Following traffic patterns isn't just about rules—it's about everyone's safety! When all rowers follow the same patterns, we can predict each other's movements and avoid collisions.</p>
