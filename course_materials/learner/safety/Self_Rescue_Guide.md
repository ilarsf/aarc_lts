# Sculling Self-Rescue Guide

<div class="info-box note">
  <h4>Essential Safety Skill</h4>
  <p>This guide explains the capsize recovery process you'll practice during your flip test. Understanding and practicing this skill builds confidence on the water and is a critical safety requirement.</p>
</div>

## Understanding Capsizing

Sculling boats are narrow by design for speed and efficiency, making them inherently less stable than recreational watercraft. Capsizing can happen for several reasons:

* **Balance and Body Position:** Small shifts in weight or uneven oar handle heights
* **Technique Errors:** "Catching a crab" (blade stuck in water) or uneven pressure
* **Oar Handling:** Challenges managing two oars independently
* **External Conditions:** Wind, waves, and boat wash from other vessels
* **The Learning Process:** Developing new balance reflexes takes time

Remember that capsizing is a normal part of learning to scull. Many experienced rowers have capsized at some point in their rowing careers!

## The Flip Test

The "Flip Test" is an intentional capsize performed in a controlled environment that serves several important purposes:

1. **Familiarization:** Experiencing a capsize in a safe setting removes the element of surprise
2. **Skill Practice:** Provides opportunity to practice self-rescue without the stress of a real emergency
3. **Reducing Panic:** Knowing you *can* get back in builds confidence and reduces fear
4. **Safety Preparedness:** Ensures scullers have demonstrated essential self-rescue skills

Successfully completing the Flip Test is a significant milestone for new scullers and is required before rowing independently.

  <h4>Safety First</h4>
  <p>Always perform your first flip test under the supervision of a qualified coach and in a controlled environment. Wear appropriate clothing and follow your coach's guidance throughout the process.</p>

## Self-Rescue Process: Step-by-Step

### Immediate Response

1. **Stay Calm and Stay With Your Boat:** The golden rule of water safety. The shell, even when swamped or upside down, provides significant buoyancy and is your primary flotation aid.
2. **Manage Your Oars:** Locate both oars immediately – they will float. Keep them nearby, as they are essential tools for stabilizing the boat during re-entry.
3. **Assess the Situation:** Note your position relative to shore and check for any immediate hazards.

### Preparing for Re-entry

1. **Right the Shell (if upside down):**
   - Approach the overturned scull from the side
   - Reach across the hull (bottom) of the boat to the far side and grab the gunwale (top edge)
   - Slowly pull the boat towards you to right it, watching out for the oars as it flips

2. **Position the Oars for Stability:**
   - Arrange both oars perpendicular to the boat (T-position)
   - Ensure blades are flat on the water surface (feathered)
   - This creates an outrigger system that dramatically improves stability

### Re-entering the Boat: Side Entry Method

<div class="info-box tip">
  <h4>Key Technique Point</h4>
  <p>The re-entry technique relies primarily on leg power, not upper body strength. The key is to use a strong kick to propel your hips up onto the gunwale, then roll into the boat.</p>
</div>

1. **Position Yourself:**
   - Swim to the middle of the boat (near the rigger)
   - Face the shell, holding onto the overlapping oar handles or the near gunwale

2. **The Kick & Hip Lift:**
   - Take a breath, dip slightly underwater
   - Execute a powerful kick (dolphin or scissor) with your legs
   - Focus on driving your hips up onto the gunwale
   - This step relies on leg power, not upper body strength

3. **The Tummy Flop & Roll:**
   - Once your hips/stomach are across the gunwale, pause briefly to balance
   - The boat will wobble – rely on the oar stability system

4. **Swing a Leg Over:**
   - Carefully swing the leg furthest from the boat over the hull and into the cockpit area

5. **Sit Up Slowly:**
   - Bring the other leg over (you might straddle the boat initially)
   - Slowly and carefully shift your weight to sit down on the seat

6. **Regain Control:**
   - Immediately check oar handles – keep them slightly elevated with blades flat on water
   - The boat will have some water in it – this is normal
   - Begin gentle rowing to shore or continue your session

### Tips for Success

* **Maximize Leg Power:** Focus on generating a strong upward thrust with your legs
* **Use Buoyancy:** The "dip and kick" technique leverages water's natural buoyancy
* **Focus on the Roll:** The body roll is about momentum and core rotation, not arm strength
* **Stay Calm:** Work methodically through each step without rushing

## Alternative Approaches

If the standard re-entry method is challenging for you, discuss these alternatives with your coach:

* **Shallow Water Re-entry:** If close to shore, consider swimming to shallow water where you can stand
* **Coach-Assisted Re-entry:** For the initial flip test, your coach may provide physical assistance
* **Stern Entry Method:** Some rowers find entering over the stern (back) of the boat easier

## Preventive Safety Practices

### Before You Launch: Critical Checks

* **Weather Assessment:** Check forecasts and current conditions
* **Equipment Checks:** Verify bow ball, hull integrity, riggers, foot stretchers, and heel restraints
* **Sign-Out:** Always follow proper boat sign-out procedures
* **Communication:** Let others know your intended route and return time

  <h4>Remember</h4>
  <p>Capsize recovery is an essential skill every sculler should master. With practice, the process becomes more comfortable and efficient. During your Learn to Scull program, your coaches will guide you through this process in a controlled, supportive environment.</p>
