# Weather Guidelines for Rowers

This guide provides essential information on weather conditions that affect rowing safety. Understanding these guidelines will help you make informed decisions about when it's safe to row.

## Quick Reference Weather Guidelines

| Condition | Safe to Row | Use Caution | Do Not Row |
|-----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Wind Speed** | <10 mph | 10-15 mph | >15 mph |
| **Wind Gusts** | <12 mph | 12-17 mph | >17 mph |
| **Whitecaps** | None | Occasional | Widespread |
| **Visibility** | >500 meters | 100-500 meters | <100 meters |
| **Lightning** | None within 30 miles | Within 30 miles, moving away | Within 30 miles, approaching |
| **Thunder** | None heard | Heard within last 30 min | Currently audible |
| **Air Temperature** | >50°F | 40-50°F | <40°F |
| **Water Temperature** | >60°F | 50-60°F | <50°F |
| **Combined (Air+Water)** | >120°F | 100-120°F | <100°F |

  <h4>Important Safety Rule</h4>
  <p>If lightning is seen or thunder heard, all boats must immediately return to the dock. No rowing is allowed for at least 30 minutes after the last observed lightning or thunder.</p>

## Boat Type Restrictions Based on Temperature

AARC has specific rules about what boats can be used based on water and air temperature conditions:

| Condition | Zone 0 | Zone 1 | Zone 2 | Zone 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Water Temp | Any | <40°F | ≥40°F | ≥50°F |
| Air Temp | ≤25°F or ≤40°F w/ precipitation | ≥50°F | ≤50°F | ≥50°F |
| Combined | Any | ≤90°F | >90°F | ≥100°F |
| Allowed Boats | None | 8+ Only | 8+, 4 Oar Rule (2X only) | 8+, 4+, 2X, 2+, 1X |

**Understanding Boat Restrictions:**
- **No Rowing (Zone 0)**: When conditions are too dangerous for any boat
- **8+ Only (Zone 1)**: Only large eight-person shells allowed in very cold conditions
- **Limited Options (Zone 2)**: Eight-person shells and doubles with four-oar rule
- **All Boats (Zone 3)**: All boat types permitted when conditions are safe

**Additional Temperature Safety Rules:**
- Singles (1X) and pairs (2-) require:
  - Water temperature ≥50°F AND
  - Combined air/water temperature ≥100°F
  - Water temperature must have been above 50°F for at least a week
- Doubles (2X) require:
  - Water temperature ≥40°F AND
  - Combined air/water temperature ≥90°F
- Safety launches are required for all practices with 8+ and 4+ boats
- Final decisions on small boat usage rest with program directors and coaches

## Wind Assessment

Wind significantly affects rowing conditions. Here's how to interpret wind effects:

**Beaufort Scale for Rowers:**

| Wind Speed (mph) | Water Condition | Rowing Impact |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| <1 | Mirror-like | Ideal conditions |
| 1-3 | Ripples, no foam | Excellent conditions |
| 4-7 | Small wavelets | Very good conditions |
| 8-12 | Large wavelets, occasional whitecaps | Good for experienced rowers, challenging for beginners |
| 13-18 | Small waves, frequent whitecaps | Challenging for all, not recommended for novices |
| 19-24 | Moderate waves, many whitecaps | Unsafe for regular shells |
| 25+ | Large waves, whitecaps, spray | No rowing |

## Cold Weather Considerations

Cold water immersion is extremely dangerous. Be aware of these risks:
- **Initial Cold Shock (1-3 minutes)**: Causes gasping and hyperventilation
- **Short-Term Swimming Failure (30 minutes)**: Loss of muscle function
- **Hypothermia (30-120 minutes)**: Body temperature drops to dangerous levels

**Protective Measures:**
- Dress in proper layers appropriate for conditions
- Pay special attention to protecting head, hands, and feet
- Wear splash-protective outer layers when needed
- Know the cold water rescue procedures before rowing

## Heat-Related Guidelines

High temperatures also present risks:
- **<80°F**: Generally safe for full practice
- **80-90°F**: Use caution and monitor for signs of heat stress
- **90-105°F**: High risk – expect modified practice (reduced duration/intensity)
- **>105°F**: Extreme risk – practice may be moved indoors

**Heat Protection:**
- Hydrate well before, during, and after rowing
- Wear appropriate clothing and sun protection
- Be aware of signs of heat illness: dizziness, nausea, headache
- Take breaks in shade when possible

## Visibility Guidelines

- Must be able to see at least 100 meters in all directions
- Must maintain visual contact with shoreline at all times
- In fog, dawn, or dusk conditions, boats must have proper lighting
- If visibility drops during rowing, immediately head toward shore

## Always Remember

1. Your coach has final authority on all water-related decisions
2. Conditions can change rapidly – continually reassess while on the water
3. When in doubt, don't go out! Safety always comes first
4. Never row alone in marginal conditions
