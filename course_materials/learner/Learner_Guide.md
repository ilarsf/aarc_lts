  <div id="safety-tab" class="tab-content">
    <h2 id="safety-first-the-flip-test-and-self-rescue">Safety First: The Flip Test and Self-Rescue</h2>

    <h3>What Is a Flip Test?</h3>
    <p>A supervised practice of capsizing and safely returning to your boat. This essential skill ensures you can handle an unexpected capsize. Experiencing this in a controlled setting removes the element of surprise and builds confidence for water safety.</p>

    <h3>Personal Safety Preparation</h3>
    <p>Before each rowing session, ensure you've taken care of these important personal safety items:</p>
    
    <h4>High-Visibility Clothing</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Critical safety requirement:</strong> Always wear bright, visible clothing when rowing</li>
      <li><strong>Preferred colors:</strong> White or bright/neon colors (yellow, orange, pink)</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Dark colors like black, navy, or dark gray that blend with the water</li>
      <li><strong>Enhanced visibility:</strong> Consider clothing with reflective elements for dawn/dusk rowing</li>
      <li><strong>Remember:</strong> Being visible to other boats and watercraft could save your life</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="mini-quiz">
      <h4>Quick Check</h4>
      <div class="mini-quiz-question">
        <p>Which color combination for high-visibility clothing is most effective for being seen on the water?</p>
        <button class="mini-quiz-toggle">Show Answer</button>
        <div class="mini-quiz-answer hidden">
          <p>Fluorescent yellow, orange, or green provide the highest visibility on water, especially in low light conditions.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Prevent Hand Injuries</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cut your fingernails:</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li>Keep fingernails short and smooth to prevent scratching your other hand</li>
          <li>During the rowing stroke, one hand passes very close to the other with nails pointing downward</li>
          <li>Long nails can cause painful scratches or cuts to your opposite hand</li>
          <li>File any sharp edges to prevent snagging on equipment or clothing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Remove rings and jewelry:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Rings can interfere with proper grip technique</li>
          <li>Jewelry may increase friction between hand and oar, leading to blisters</li>
          <li>Rings can catch on equipment and cause injury</li>
          <li>Consider removing watches and bracelets that might restrict movement</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Secure long hair:</strong> Tie back long hair to prevent it getting caught in moving parts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Understanding Capsizing</h3>
    <p>Sculling boats are narrow by design for speed and efficiency, making them inherently less stable than recreational watercraft. Capsizing can happen for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Balance and Body Position:</strong> Small shifts in weight or uneven oar handle heights</li>
      <li><strong>Technique Errors:</strong> "Catching a crab" (blade stuck in water) or uneven pressure</li>
      <li><strong>Oar Handling:</strong> Challenges managing two oars independently</li>
      <li><strong>External Conditions:</strong> Wind, waves, and boat wash from other vessels</li>
      <li><strong>The Learning Process:</strong> Developing new balance reflexes takes time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember that capsizing is a normal part of learning to scull. Many experienced rowers have capsized at some point in their rowing careers!</p>

    <h3>The Self-Rescue Process: Detailed Steps</h3>
    
    <h4>Immediate Response</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Stay Calm and Stay With Your Boat:</strong> The golden rule of water safety. The shell, even when swamped or upside down, provides significant buoyancy and is your primary flotation aid.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage Your Oars:</strong> Locate both oars immediately – they will float. Keep them nearby, as they are essential tools for stabilizing the boat during re-entry.</li>
      <li><strong>Assess the Situation:</strong> Note your position relative to shore and check for any immediate hazards.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Preparing for Re-entry</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Right the Shell (if upside down):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Approach the overturned scull from the side</li>
          <li>Reach across the hull (bottom) of the boat to the far side and grab the gunwale (top edge)</li>
          <li>Slowly pull the boat towards you to right it, watching out for the oars as it flips</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Position the Oars for Stability:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Arrange both oars perpendicular to the boat (T-position)</li>
          <li>Ensure blades are flat on the water surface (feathered)</li>
          <li>This creates an outrigger system that dramatically improves stability</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Re-entering the Boat: Side Entry Method</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Position Yourself:</strong> Swim to the middle of the boat (near the rigger). Face the shell, holding onto the overlapping oar handles or the near gunwale.</li>
      <li><strong>The Kick & Hip Lift:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Take a breath, dip slightly underwater</li>
          <li>Execute a powerful kick (dolphin or scissor) with your legs</li>
          <li>Focus on driving your hips up onto the gunwale</li>
          <li>This step relies on leg power, not upper body strength</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>The Tummy Flop & Roll:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Once your hips/stomach are across the gunwale, pause briefly to balance</li>
          <li>The boat will wobble – rely on the oar stability system</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Swing a Leg Over:</strong> Carefully swing the leg furthest from the boat over the hull and into the cockpit area.</li>
      <li><strong>Sit Up Slowly:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Bring the other leg over (you might straddle the boat initially)</li>
          <li>Slowly and carefully shift your weight to sit down on the seat</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Regain Control:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Immediately check oar handles – keep them slightly elevated with blades flat on water</li>
          <li>The boat will have some water in it – this is normal</li>
          <li>Begin gentle rowing to shore or continue your session</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

      </li>
      <li><strong>Never row alone as a beginner:</strong> Until you're signed off by coaches, always row during supervised sessions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Caring for Your Hands</h3>
    <p>Rowing can cause blisters, especially for beginners. This is a normal part of the learning process as your hands adapt to the unique demands of the sport.</p>
    
    <div class="video-container">

    <div class="video-item">
      <p><strong>Correct Grip Tutorial</strong> - The proper grip technique is the first step in preventing blisters</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Prevention Strategies</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Develop proper grip technique:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintain a relaxed "hook" grip rather than a tight "death grip"</li>
          <li>Let the oar handle sit in the fingers with light pressure</li>
          <li>Think of "fingers as hooks, not fists"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Allow for gradual conditioning:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with shorter rowing sessions and gradually increase duration</li>
          <li>Allow calluses to form naturally over time</li>
          <li>Be patient with the adaptation process</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Use preventative protection:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Apply athletic tape to vulnerable areas <em>before</em> blisters form</li>
          <li>Ensure tape is applied to clean, dry hands at least 20 minutes before rowing</li>
          <li>Consider using rowing gloves if you continue to have significant issues</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For comprehensive guidance on blister treatment and management, see our <a href="../../src/Rowers_Hand_Blister_Treatment.md">Rower's Hand Blister Treatment</a> guide and the <a href="QA_Companion.html#videos-tab">Video Library</a> for more technique demonstrations.</p>

    <h4>Blister Treatment</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>For intact blisters:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>If small, keep the blister intact as the skin provides natural protection</li>
          <li>Cover with a hydrocolloid blister bandage or athletic tape with padding</li>
          <li>Protect from further friction during rowing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>For popped or torn blisters:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Clean the area gently with mild soap and water</li>
          <li>Apply antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly</li>
          <li>Cover with a non-stick dressing and secure with tape</li>
          <li>Change dressing daily and after rowing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Watch for infection signs:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Increasing pain, redness spreading beyond the blister area</li>
          <li>Warmth, swelling, or pus formation</li>
          <li>If signs of infection appear, seek medical attention</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Rowing with Hand Issues</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proper protection:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Always place a non-stick barrier over open blisters before taping</li>
