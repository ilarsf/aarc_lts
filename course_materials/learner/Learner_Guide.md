## The Rowing Stroke: A Beginner's Guide

### The Catch
- Knees bent, shins vertical
- Arms extended forward
- Upper body leaning slightly forward
- Blades squared and ready to enter water

### The Drive
1. Press with legs while keeping arms straight
2. Once legs are nearly flat, engage the back
3. Finally, pull with arms to bring handles to body
4. Key point: Legs → Back → Arms

### The Finish
- Legs extended
- Slight lean back with strong core
- Handles drawn to lower ribs
- Blades fully covered by water

### The Recovery
1. Extend arms away from body
2. Pivot forward from hips
3. Begin bending knees to slide forward
4. Key point: Arms → Back → Legs (reverse of drive)

## Essential Sculling Techniques

### Balancing the Boat
- Keep weight centered in the boat
- Maintain even pressure on both feet
- Use small adjustments rather than overcorrecting
- Practice: "Rock the boat" drill to find center point

### Blade Control
- **Square**: Blades perpendicular to water (for stability)
- **Feathered**: Blades parallel to water (for reduced air resistance)
- Practice transitioning between positions with control

### Steering Basics
- Apply slightly more pressure on one side to turn
- Look ahead to maintain your course
- Small adjustments are better than large corrections

## Safety First: The Flip Test and Self-Rescue

### What Is a Flip Test?
A supervised practice of capsizing and safely returning to your boat. This essential skill ensures you can handle an unexpected capsize.

### The Self-Rescue Process
1. Stay with your boat if you capsize
2. Position yourself at the midpoint of the boat
3. Position the oars perpendicular to the boat (T-position)
4. Use the oars for stability as you remount your boat

### Water Safety Rules
- Always wear appropriate safety gear
- Check weather conditions before rowing
- Be aware of other water traffic
- Know the local waterway rules
- Never row alone as a beginner

## Caring for Your Hands
Rowing can cause blisters, especially for beginners. Here are some tips to protect your hands:

- Start with shorter rowing sessions
- Use athletic tape for vulnerable areas
- Keep hands clean and dry when possible
- Use appropriate rowing gloves if needed
- Treat any blisters promptly with proper first aid

## Next Steps After the Course
- Join scheduled open sculling sessions
- Consider club membership for regular access
- Participate in coached intermediate sessions
- Connect with the rowing community
