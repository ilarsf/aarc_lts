# Program Schedule: Learn to Scull

<div class="info-box note">
  <h4>Weekend Intensive Format</h4>
  <p>The AARC Learn to Scull program uses a weekend intensive format, delivering the complete curriculum over two consecutive weekends. This format is designed for efficient skill development while accommodating busy schedules.</p>
</div>

## Weekend Intensive Schedule

The program consists of 4 sessions (3 hours each) scheduled across two consecutive weekends:

<div class="two-col-grid">
  <div>
    <h3>Weekend 1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Saturday:</strong> Session 1 (8:00-11:00am)</li>
      <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> Session 2 (8:00-11:00am)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3>Weekend 2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Saturday:</strong> Session 3 (8:00-11:00am)</li>
      <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> Session 4 (8:00-11:00am)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note: Each session includes a 30-minute break. Remember to bring your own water and snacks.</em></p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="info-box warning">
  <h4>Physical Considerations</h4>
  <p>This intensive format can be physically demanding, especially for those new to rowing. Participants should be prepared for:</p>
  <ul class="mb-0">
    <li>Multiple sessions in a single day during the first weekend</li>
    <li>Hand sensitivity and potential blister development</li>
    <li>Possibility of bruising during the flip test, particularly on legs, torso, and arms</li>
    <li>Cumulative fatigue across consecutive days of learning</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Session Progression

The curriculum follows a structured progression regardless of the scheduling format:

<div class="two-col-grid">
  <div>
    <h3>Sessions 1-2: Fundamentals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduction to equipment</li>
      <li>Basic rowing motion</li>
      <li>Safety procedures and flip test</li>
      <li>Getting in/out of boats</li>
      <li>First on-water experiences</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3>Sessions 3-4: Integration and Application</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Developing proper stroke sequencing</li>

      <li>Building endurance and confidence</li>
      <li>Final assessment and skill verification</li>
      <li>Planning post-program continuation</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
</div>

## Weather Contingencies

<div class="info-box">
  <h4>Schedule Adjustments</h4>
  <p>Rowing is weather-dependent. If sessions need to be canceled due to unsafe conditions (lightning, excessive wind, or heavy rain), we will schedule make-up sessions as needed.</p>
</div>

The following conditions may impact our ability to hold on-water sessions:
- Lightning or thunderstorms within viewing or hearing distance
- Sustained winds over 12 mph or wind gusts over 15 mph
- Heavy rain that affects visibility
- Fog that reduces visibility below 100 meters
- Unsafe water conditions (excessive current, debris, or contamination)

We recommend keeping the following weekend partially open as a contingency for weather-related rescheduling.

## Self-Care Between Sessions

<div class="two-col-grid">
  <div>
    <h3>Hand Care</h3>
    <p>Given the compressed nature of the weekend format, proper hand care is essential:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply preventative tape before blisters form</li>
      <li>Treat any developing blisters promptly</li>
      <li>Maintain proper grip technique to minimize friction</li>
      <li>Follow our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/src/Rowers_Hand_Blister_Treatment.html">Hand Care Guide</a> between sessions</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3>Recovery Practices</h3>
    <p>To maintain energy and performance across multiple sessions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay well-hydrated throughout both weekends</li>
      <li>Consume adequate calories to fuel multiple sessions</li>
      <li>Use breaks between sessions for true rest</li>
      <li>Consider gentle stretching in the evenings</li>
      <li>Get adequate sleep during the program</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## Preparing for Your Sessions

<div class="info-box info mb-3">
  <h4>Pre-Session Video Learning</h4>
  <p>To maximize your on-water time, we recommend reviewing the appropriate videos in our <a href="../learner/technical/Instructional_Videos.html">Sculling Instructional Video Library</a> before each session:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Before Session 1:</strong> Introduction to Sculling and Safety videos</li>
    <li><strong>Before Session 2:</strong> Equipment Adjustments and Stroke Overview videos</li>
    <li><strong>Before Session 3:</strong> Finish, Recovery and Blade Work videos</li>
    <li><strong>Before Session 4:</strong> Drills and Advanced Skills videos</li>
  </ul>
</div>

To get the most out of the intensive weekend format:

1. **Arrive Well-Rested:** Begin the program with adequate sleep and energy reserves.
2. **Hydration:** Bring a water bottle to each session and hydrate consistently.
3. **Nutrition:** Plan appropriate meals/snacks for the breaks between same-day sessions.
4. **Sun Protection:** Bring sunscreen, hat, and sunglasses for on-water sessions.
5. **Comfortable Clothing:** Wear athletic clothes that allow freedom of movement.
6. **Video Preparation:** Review the recommended videos for upcoming session content.
7. **Mindset:** Approach the intensive format with patience - remember that rowing technique develops gradually, even if sessions are close together.

## What to Bring

For each session, please bring:
- Water bottle (at least 32 oz / 1 liter)
- Sunscreen (water-resistant, SPF 30+)
- Hat with brim and sunglasses
- Athletic clothing appropriate for the weather. Ideally bright colors
- Towel and change of clothes (in case of getting wet)
- Hand tape or blister care supplies
- Small snack

<div class="info-box tip">
  <h4>Weekends: A Total Immersion</h4>
  <p>While the weekend format is more intensive physically, it offers the benefit of complete immersion in the learning process. Many participants find the concentrated practice accelerates their skill development, as each session builds directly on the previous one with minimal time for skills to fade between sessions.</p>
