# Welcome to the Ann Arbor Rowing Club Learn to Scull Program!

## Get Ready for Your Rowing Adventure!

We are thrilled you've decided to embark on your sculling journey with the Ann Arbor Rowing Club (AARC)! Sculling, where you use two oars to glide across the water in your own boat, offers a unique blend of physical activity, technical skill, and peaceful connection with the Huron River. This packet is designed to give you a head start, providing essential information to help you feel prepared and excited for your first session.

### What is Sculling?

Sculling involves propelling a narrow boat (shell) using two oars (sculls), one in each hand. Unlike sweep rowing where each rower has one larger oar, sculling offers greater independence and a direct feel for how your movements affect the boat. You'll learn to navigate the boat yourself, connecting deeply with the water and the rhythm of the stroke.

### Goals of the Learn to Scull Program

Our program is designed to take you from a complete beginner to a confident novice sculler. Over our four sessions, we aim to:

1.  Introduce the **basic technique** of sculling using both land-based training (like the ergometer) and on-water practice in single sculls.
2.  Cover essential **safety protocols** and boat handling skills, including capsize recovery.
3.  Familiarize you with rowing **terminology** and equipment care.
4.  Build your **confidence** and prepare you for continued rowing with AARC.

## Program Overview

### Format: Weekend Intensive

Our program uses a weekend intensive format, with four 3-hour sessions held over two consecutive weekends (Saturday & Sunday, typically 8:00 AM - 11:00 AM). This immersive approach helps accelerate learning and skill retention. Each session includes instruction, practice, and a break.

  * **Weekend 1:** Sessions 1 & 2 - Focus on fundamentals, basic motion, and water safety (including the flip test).
  * **Weekend 2:** Sessions 3 & 4 - Focus on power application, navigation, technique refinement, and independent sculling.

*For detailed dates and times for your specific class, please refer to your registration confirmation and pre-course emails.*

### What to Expect Physically

  * **New Muscles:** Rowing engages muscles you might not use often! Expect some initial muscle soreness.
  * **Hand Care:** Blisters are a common part of learning as your hands adapt. We'll cover prevention and care.
  * **Balance Challenge:** Sculling shells are narrow; learning to balance is part of the fun and the skill!
  * **Getting Wet:** You *will* get wet during the mandatory, supervised "flip test" (capsize recovery practice) in the first session.
  * **Mobility:** You'll need the ability to get down low to enter/exit the boat safely.

### The Learning Journey

1.  **Fundamentals:** Getting comfortable with the equipment, basic stroke motion on the erg, water safety, and the crucial flip test.
2.  **Basic Technique:** Transferring skills to the water, learning balance, executing the basic stroke sequence (catch, drive, finish, recovery), and basic steering.
3.  **Skill Refinement:** Coordinating the full stroke cycle, learning blade work (squaring/feathering), applying power effectively, and rowing continuously.
4.  **Independence:** Launching/docking solo, navigating the river confidently following traffic patterns, demonstrating proficient technique and safety awareness.

## Preparing for Your First Session

### What to Wear

  * **Athletic Clothing:** Wear snug-fitting (but not restrictive) athletic wear. **Avoid baggy shorts/pants** that can get caught in the sliding seat tracks. Moisture-wicking fabric is best.
  * **Layers:** Dress for the weather, using layers you can remove as you warm up.
  * **Socks:** Necessary for comfort in the boat's foot stretchers.
  * **Shoes:** Wear regular athletic shoes to the boathouse; you'll likely take them off before getting in the boat, which has built-in foot stretchers.

### What to Bring (Essential!)

  * **Water Bottle:** LARGE (32 oz / ≥1 Liter). Hydration is critical.
  * **Sun Protection:** Sunscreen (water-resistant), hat with a brim, sunglasses. Water reflects sunlight strongly.
  * **Towel & Complete Change of Clothes:** For after the flip test in Session 1.
  * **Required Forms:** Ensure your AARC and USRowing waivers are complete.
  * **Small Snack:** Useful during the session break.
  * **(Optional) Hand Care:** Athletic tape or blister kit if you're prone to blisters.

### Arrival & Boathouse Etiquette

  * **Location:** Meet at the Bandemer Park boathouse. Check pre-course emails for the exact meeting spot.
  * **Time:** Arrive **15 minutes early** for your *first* session for orientation. Arrive 5-10 minutes early for subsequent sessions.
  * **Facilities:** Note there are no dedicated locker rooms at Bandemer.
  * **Listen Up:** Pay close attention to coaches, especially during safety briefings and boat handling. Minimize chatter when instructions are being given.
  * **Respect Equipment & Space:** Handle boats and oars carefully as instructed.

## Safety First: Your Top Priority

Rowing is incredibly safe when protocols are followed.

### The Flip Test (Capsize Recovery)

This mandatory, supervised drill teaches you how to recover if your boat flips.

  * **Stay Calm & Stay With Your Boat:** Your shell provides buoyancy.
  * **Manage Oars:** Keep them nearby; they help stabilize for re-entry.
  * **Right the Shell:** If upside down, gently flip it back over.
  * **T-Position Oars:** Arrange oars perpendicular to the boat, blades flat on water, for stability.
  * **Re-Enter:** Use leg power (kick!) to get your hips onto the boat, then roll in. *Your coach will guide you through this step-by-step.*

*Watch the Flip Test demonstration videos (available on the [Video Library tab of the Q&A Companion page]({{ site.baseurl }}/course_materials/learner/QA_Companion.html#videos-tab)) and review the [Self-Rescue Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/course_materials/learner/safety/Self_Rescue_Guide.html) online for details.*

### Weather & Water Conditions

  * **Coach's Call:** Coaches make the final decision about rowing based on weather.
  * **Key Concerns:** Lightning/Thunder (immediate stop - must wait 30 mins after last sight/sound), high wind/whitecaps, poor visibility (fog), extreme cold.
  * **Check Communications:** If weather is questionable, check email/text before heading to the boathouse.

### River Traffic Rules

  * **Stay Right:** Always keep to the starboard (right) side of the river relative to your direction.
  * **Look Around:** Check over your shoulder every 3-5 strokes. Be aware of other boats, kayaks, obstacles.
  * **Bridges:** Follow specific procedures taught by your coach (designated arches, no passing).

### Equipment Checks

  * Before launching, quickly check your boat: bow ball secure, riggers tight, heel restraints functional, oarlocks working.

*You can find full details in the [AARC Safety Rules]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/AARC_Safety_Rules.pdf) and the [AARC SafeSport Policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/AARCSafeSport_2015-01-18.pdf).*

## Getting Started with Technique & Equipment

### Basic Rowing Stroke (The Cycle)

You'll learn this in detail, but here’s a preview:

1.  **Catch:** Blades enter the water; legs compressed, body forward, arms extended.
2.  **Drive:** Propel the boat using Legs -\> Back -\> Arms sequence.
3.  **Finish/Release:** Legs straight, slight lean back, draw handles to body, extract blades cleanly.
4.  **Recovery:** Return to catch position using Arms -\> Body -\> Legs sequence, blades feathered (parallel to water).

### Key Equipment

  * **Shell:** Your boat!
  * **Sculls:** Your two oars.
  * **Oarlocks & Riggers:** Hold the oars out from the boat.
  * **Foot Stretcher:** Where your feet go.
  * **Seat & Tracks:** Allows you to slide back and forth.

### Hand Care (Blisters)

  * **Prevention:** Use a relaxed grip (fingers as hooks, not a death grip). Let hands adapt gradually. Tape known hot spots *before* rowing. *(See the Correct Grip video on the [Video Library tab of the Q&A Companion page]({{ site.baseurl }}/course_materials/learner/QA_Companion.html#videos-tab))*
  * **Treatment:** Keep clean, cover appropriately. See the [Hand Care Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/Rowers_Hand_Blister_Treatment.html) for details.
