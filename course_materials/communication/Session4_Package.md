# Session 4: Becoming an Independent Sculler

Welcome to your final Learn to Scull session! This session marks an important transition as we focus on developing your independence as a sculler. By the end of today, you'll have the foundational skills needed to continue your rowing journey.

## Sessions 1-3 Recap

Your learning journey has included:
* Water safety training
* Equipment handling and boat care
* Technical fundamentals of the rowing stroke
* Balance and basic navigation skills
* Blade control and power application

### Final Flip Test Opportunity

This session represents your final opportunity to complete the flip test if you haven't already done so:

* **Requirement:** Successful completion of the flip test is mandatory for program graduation and participation in the Open Sculling Program
* **Today's Focus:** If you still need to complete the flip test, please inform your coach immediately at the beginning of the session
* **Priority:** We will ensure that anyone who still needs to complete the flip test has the opportunity to do so during this final session
* **Support:** Our coaches will provide additional guidance and support to help you succeed

Remember, the flip test is a safety requirement designed to ensure you can handle an emergency situation confidently.

## Session 4 Focus Areas

In this final session, we'll concentrate on independence and integration:

* **Solo Launching & Docking:** Learning to safely get on and off the water independently

* **Extended Rowing:** Building endurance with longer continuous rowing
* **Problem Solving:** Handling common challenges on the water
* **Next Steps:** Information on continuing with AARC after the course

## River Navigation Skills

Safe navigation is essential for independent rowing:

* **Traffic Pattern:** Always stay to the starboard/right side of the river in your direction of travel
* **Looking Around:** Check behind you every 3-5 strokes by turning your head, not your entire body
* **Bridge Navigation:** Follow specific procedures for passing through bridges
* **Hazard Recognition:** Identify and avoid obstacles like logs, shallow areas, or wildlife
* **Communication:** Understanding standard calls and warnings used on the water
* **Visibility:** Always wear bright, high-visibility clothing (neon yellow, orange, red) to be seen by other watercraft
