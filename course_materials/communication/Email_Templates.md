### Post-Session Email Templates

#### Post-Session 1 Email (Same Evening)
**Subject:** Learn to Scull Day #1 - Progress and Next Steps

Dear Sculling Class,

Great work today in your first Learn to Scull session! I was particularly impressed with your enthusiasm and willingness to try new things, especially during the flip test.

**Today's Highlights:**
- We learned basic boathouse procedures and safety rules
- You practiced the rowing stroke on the ergometer
- We introduced essential equipment handling techniques
- Many of you completed the flip test successfully

**Individual Progress Notes:**
Many of you are making excellent progress with understanding the basic stroke sequence. Some areas to focus on before our next session include:
- Maintaining proper sequencing (legs-back-arms, then arms-back-legs)
- Relaxing your grip on the handles to prevent blisters

**For Practice:**
Visualize your rowing stroke, focusing on the sequence: legs-back-arms on the drive, and arms-back-legs on the recovery. This mental practice actually helps develop muscle memory.

**Video Resources:**
To reinforce today's lessons, check out:
- Basic Rowing Sequence: https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/course_materials/learner/QA_Companion.html#videos-tab
- Hand Care Guide: https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/src/Rowers_Hand_Blister_Treatment.html

**Next Session Preview:**
In Session 2, we'll build on today's skills by introducing more blade work and refining your stroke. We'll spend more time on the water practicing these skills.

Remember to bring your water bottle, bright clothing, and hand care supplies to our next class on [date/time].

#### Post-Session 2 Email (Same Evening)
**Subject:** Learn to Scull Day #2 - Progress and Next Steps

Dear Sculling Class,

Excellent work today in your second Learn to Scull session! I was particularly impressed with your improvement in boat balance and basic stroke technique.

**Today's Highlights:**
- We refined the fundamental phases of the rowing stroke
- You practiced blade control, including entry and exit from the water
- We worked on proper body positioning in the boat
- You gained more comfort with balance in the shell

**Individual Progress Notes:**
Many of you are making excellent progress with balance and coordination. Some areas to focus on before our next session include:
- Maintaining consistent hand heights through the stroke
- Developing a more relaxed recovery phase

**For Practice:**
Think about the "Black Bear Sequence" we discussed: Grip and feather → Release → Recovery/Catch → Drive → Steering. Visualization of these components will help integrate them into your rowing.

**Video Resources:**
To reinforce today's lessons, check out:
- Correct Grip Tutorial: https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/course_materials/learner/QA_Companion.html#videos-tab
- Technical Frameworks: https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/course_materials/learner/technical/Technical_Frameworks.html
