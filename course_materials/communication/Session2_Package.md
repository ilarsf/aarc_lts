# Session 2: Building Your Sculling Foundation

You've completed your first Learn to Scull session - congratulations! Now that you've experienced the flip test and gained familiarity with the equipment, Session 2 will focus on developing your basic sculling technique.

## Session 1 Recap

In our first session, you:
* Learned basic terminology and equipment handling
* Practiced the rowing stroke on the ergometer
* Attempted or completed the flip test
* Gained initial experience with boat balance and basic strokes

### Flip Test Status

If you successfully completed the flip test in Session 1 - congratulations on this major milestone! 

If you did not attempt or complete the flip test during Session 1, don't worry. You'll have additional opportunities to practice and complete it during Sessions 2, 3, or 4. Please let your coach know if you'd like to attempt it during this session. We typically recommend doing this toward the end of the session.

## Session 2 Focus Areas

In this second session, we'll build on these foundations:

* **Stroke Refinement:** Working on the fundamental phases of the rowing stroke
* **Blade Work:** Introduction to blade control, including entry and exit from the water
* **Body Positioning:** Finding the proper body positions for effective rowing
* **Balance Skills:** More practice with maintaining balance in the boat
* **Basic Steering:** Introduction to steering concepts and techniques

## Tips From Session 1

Based on common challenges from the first session:

* **Grip:** Remember to hold the oars with a relaxed grip - "hang" from the handles rather than squeezing
* **Sequence:** Focus on the legs-body-arms sequence during the drive and the arms-body-legs sequence during recovery
* **Posture:** Keep your back straight but relaxed, pivoting from the hips rather than hunching
* **Balance:** Look forward, not down at your feet, to help maintain balance
* **Timing:** Be patient with yourself - coordination takes time to develop!

## Preparing for Session 2

To make the most of your second session:

* **Rest Your Body:** If you're sore from Session 1, gentle stretching can help
* **Hand Care:** If you developed blisters, follow the [Hand Care Guide](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/src/Rowers_Hand_Blister_Treatment.html) for treatment
* **Mental Preparation:** Review the [Basic Rowing Stroke](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/course_materials/learner/technical/Technical_Frameworks.html) components
* **Weather Check:** Dress appropriately for the forecast conditions

## What to Bring

The same items as for Session 1:
* Water bottle (32 oz / ≥1 liter)
* Athletic clothing (non-baggy)
* **Bright Colors:** Wear bright, high-visibility clothing (neon yellow, orange, red) for safety on the water
* Sun protection
* Hand care items if needed
* Small snack for the break

## Looking Ahead

By the end of Session 2, you should feel more comfortable with the basic sculling motion and boat handling. In Sessions 3 and 4, we'll focus on refining your technique, building endurance, and developing independence on the water.

*If you have questions before Session 2, please reach out to your coach. We're here to support your learning journey!*
