# Part 3: Safety

## Chapter 6: On-Water Safety Protocols

Safety is the foundation of enjoyable rowing. This chapter outlines the essential protocols and awareness needed *before* you even launch and while you are on the water. Adhering to these practices ensures not only your safety but the safety of everyone sharing the river.

### Weather and Water Condition Assessment

Conditions on the water can change quickly. Always assess the weather and water before launching. Your coaches are responsible for making the final call on whether practice proceeds, but every rower should be aware of these factors:

* **Weather Forecast:** Check for predicted wind speed/direction, thunderstorms, temperature changes, and precipitation.
* **Lightning & Thunder:** Rowing activities **must** be postponed or curtailed if lightning is seen or thunder is heard within the **previous 30 minutes**.
* **Wind:** High winds (e.g., sustained over 12 mph or gusts over 15 mph) can make rowing difficult and dangerous, especially for beginners. Whitecaps on the water are a sign of high wind.
* **Temperature (Air & Water):** Cold water significantly increases the risk of hypothermia if you capsize. Dress appropriately in layers. Your coaches follow specific temperature guidelines, especially regarding the use of singles and doubles in early spring or late fall.
* **Visibility:** Fog or heavy rain can severely reduce visibility, making it hard to see obstacles or other boats. Avoid rowing if visibility is less than ~100 meters.
* **River Conditions:** Check for strong currents (especially after heavy rain) and debris (logs, branches) in the water.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Never underestimate the weather. If in doubt, stay ashore. Your coach has the final authority to cancel practice due to unsafe conditions.

### Essential Equipment Checks

Before every row, perform a quick safety inspection of your boat and oars. This takes only a minute and can prevent serious problems.

#### Boat Checks:

* **Bow Ball:** Ensure it's securely attached and not damaged. This is a critical safety feature.
* **Hull Integrity:** Look for any visible cracks or damage to the boat's body.
* **Riggers:** Check that riggers are securely bolted to the boat.
* **Oarlocks/Gates:** Make sure the gates close properly and hold the oar securely.
* **Foot Stretchers:** Confirm they are adjusted correctly for you and securely fastened.
* **Heel Restraints:** **Crucially important!** Check that the straps limiting heel lift are functional and allow quick foot release in case of capsize.
* **Seat & Tracks:** Ensure the seat slides smoothly and tracks are clear.

#### Oar Checks:

* **Collars/Buttons:** Verify they are securely fastened and correctly positioned.
* **Blades/Shafts:** Check for any cracks or significant damage.

**Reporting Issues:** If you find *any* problems with the equipment, **do not use it**. Report the issue immediately to your coach and make an entry in the boat logbook.

### Following Traffic Patterns

As discussed in Chapter 5, knowing and adhering to the established river traffic pattern is vital for safety. Remember the key principles:

* Stay to the **starboard (right)** side of the river.
* Pass other boats safely (usually towards the center of the river).
* Turn appropriately at designated points.
* **Look around constantly** (every 3-5 strokes).

Following these rules prevents collisions and ensures predictable movement for all water users.

### Communication: Commands and Signals

Clear communication on the water is essential.

* **Coach Signals:** Your coach will use voice commands, a megaphone, or whistle signals. Common whistle signals include:
    * One blast: Get attention / Stop rowing.
    * Multiple blasts: Emergency / Hazard.
* **Rowing Commands:** Learn basic commands your coach might use, such as:
    * "Way Enough" (or "Weigh Enough"): Stop rowing.
    * "Hold Water": Stop the boat quickly by squaring blades in the water.
    * "Let it Run": Stop rowing and glide.
* **Distress Signal:** The universal signal for distress on the water is repeatedly raising and lowering both arms overhead.
* **Verbal Communication:** Keep chatter minimal while rowing to ensure commands can be heard.

üí° **Tip:** Always prioritize safety. It is the responsibility of every person on the water to look out for themselves and others. If you feel unsafe for any reason, communicate this to your coach immediately.

## Chapter 6A: Boathouse Rules and Equipment Care

Proper care and handling of equipment not only extends its lifespan but also ensures it remains in good working condition for everyone. This chapter covers important boathouse etiquette and equipment maintenance responsibilities.

### General Boathouse Rules

* **Sign Out/In:** Always record your boat usage in the logbook, including any issues encountered during your row.
* **Footwear:** Wear appropriate footwear in the boathouse. No street shoes on the dock or in the boats.
* **Quiet Hours:** Respect neighbors by minimizing noise during early morning hours.
* **Security:** The last person leaving the boathouse is responsible for ensuring all doors and gates are locked.
* **Keep Pathways Clear:** Never leave equipment blocking walkways, doorways, or launch areas.

### Equipment Handling and Storage

#### Boat Handling

* **Carrying Boats:** Always lift with proper technique and adequate help. Listen to experienced rowers regarding the correct carrying positions.
* **Using Slings/Stretchers:** Place boats carefully on stretchers when adjusting foot stretchers or performing maintenance.
* **Step Ladders:** Use the provided step ladders for reaching high racks; never climb on the racks themselves. Return ladders to their designated storage locations after use.

#### Boat Maintenance

1. **Cleaning the Boat**  
   Before putting the boat back on its rack, place it on the stretchers/slings and thoroughly wipe it down using a rag/towel provided by the club. This ensures the equipment is clean and ready for the next use.

2. **Storing the Boat**  
   After cleaning, place the boat back in its original rack position. Ensure the riggers align with those of other boats on the rack to maintain uniformity and balance. Make sure it is properly supported to prevent damage.

3. **Reporting Issues**  
   Please note any issues with the equipment in the logbook. If there is significant damage, also notify a coach or club officer immediately.

#### Oar Care and Storage

* **Oar Storage:** Return oars to their designated racks after use, with blades facing in the correct direction as indicated by the rack labels.

* **Oar Cleaning:** After each use, rinse oars with fresh water if available, paying special attention to the collars and gates.

* **Oar Handles**  
   Routinely disinfect oar handles after each row. This is crucial for maintaining hygiene and preventing the spread of germs, especially given the likelihood of blisters and potential bleeding. Additionally, it removes residues from bandages or tapes some rowers might use.

* **Tape Removal:** If you've used tape on the handles for blisters, remove it completely after your row. Sticky residue makes handles uncomfortable for the next user.

### Considerate Use of Facilities

* **Changing Rooms:** Keep changing areas tidy and remove all personal belongings after use.
* **Bathrooms:** Leave the facilities as you would like to find them.
* **Trash:** Dispose of all waste properly and recycle when possible.
* **Personal Items:** Do not leave valuables unattended in the boathouse.

### Equipment Respect Philosophy

Remember that rowing equipment is both expensive and delicate. Approach each interaction with equipment by following these principles:

* **Respect Your Future Self:** The care you take now ensures the equipment will be in good condition for your next row.
* **Respect Your Peers:** Other rowers deserve to use well-maintained equipment just as you do.
* **Respect the Club's Investment:** Proper care of equipment protects the club's financial investment and allows resources to be directed to improvements rather than replacements.

üí° **Tip:** If you're unsure about any aspect of equipment handling or boathouse procedures, ask an experienced member or coach. It's better to ask than to risk damaging equipment or breaking protocol.

Understanding and practicing these boathouse rules and equipment care principles forms the bedrock of responsible rowing. The next chapter addresses another key safety skill: what to do if you capsize.

## Chapter 7: Capsize Recovery: The Flip Test & Self-Rescue

Capsizing, or flipping your boat, might seem daunting, but it's a normal part of learning to scull. The boats are narrow, and finding your balance takes practice. This chapter teaches you the most important safety skill: how to get back into your boat safely and confidently after a capsize. You'll practice this under supervision during the "Flip Test."

### Why We Practice the Flip Test

The Flip Test is an intentional, supervised capsize and recovery drill typically done near the dock during your first session. It's crucial for several reasons:

* **Familiarization:** Experiencing a capsize in a safe setting removes the fear of the unknown.
* **Skill Practice:** It's your chance to learn and practice the self-rescue technique without the stress of a real emergency.
* **Confidence Building:** Knowing you *can* get back in significantly reduces anxiety about capsizing during regular rowing.
* **Safety Requirement:** Demonstrating this skill is essential for safe rowing.

üí° **Tip:** Everyone feels a bit awkward during their first flip test! Relax, listen to your coach, and focus on the steps.

### Understanding Capsizing (Briefly)

As mentioned before, capsizing can happen due to balance shifts, technique errors (like catching a crab), challenging water conditions, or simply during the learning process. It's usually not dramatic ‚Äì often just a slow roll. Understanding this helps demystify the experience.

### Step-by-Step Self-Rescue Process

If you capsize, follow these steps. Remember, your boat and oars float!

#### 1. Immediate Response

* **Stay Calm:** Take a breath. Panic makes recovery harder.
* **Stay With Your Boat:** **This is the most important rule.** Your shell provides significant flotation, even if swamped. Hold onto it.
* **Manage Your Oars:** Locate both oars quickly (they float!) and keep them nearby. You'll need them.

#### 2. Preparing for Re-entry

* **Right the Shell (If Necessary):** If the boat is upside down, swim to the side, reach across the bottom (hull) to grab the far gunwale (top edge), and gently pull it towards you to roll it upright. Watch out for the riggers as it flips.

    ![Placeholder: Illustration showing how to right an overturned shell](image-link-placeholder)
* **Position the Oars (T-Position):** This creates stability.
    * Arrange one oar perpendicular to the boat, blade flat (feathered) on the water.
    * Do the same with the other oar, creating a 'T' shape with the boat.
    * Overlap the handles near the cockpit.

    ![Placeholder: Diagram showing oars in stable T-Position, blades flat](image-link-placeholder)

#### 3. Re-entering the Boat (Side Entry Method)

This technique uses leg power, not arm strength.

* **Position Yourself:** Swim to the middle of the boat, near the riggers. Face the shell.
* **Get Your Grip:** Grasp the overlapped oar handles with the hand closer to the stern. Place your other hand firmly on the boat near the center (e.g., center strip or near gunwale).

    ![Placeholder: Photo showing starting position for re-entry](image-link-placeholder)
* **The Kick & Hip Lift:** This is the key move!
    * Take a breath and let yourself sink slightly underwater.
    * Execute a powerful kick (like a dolphin or scissor kick) straight up.
    * Simultaneously, push down on the oar handles/boat with your hands.
    * Focus on driving your **hips** up and onto the gunwale/deck beside the cockpit. Aim to get your belly button over the edge.

    ![Placeholder: Photo demonstrating the kick and hip lift onto the gunwale](image-link-placeholder)
* **The Tummy Flop & Roll:**
    * Once your hips/stomach are across the gunwale, pause briefly to balance. The boat will wobble ‚Äì trust the stability from your T-positioned oars.
    * Roll your body towards the boat.
* **Swing a Leg Over:** Carefully swing the leg furthest from the boat *over* the hull and into the cockpit area.
* **Sit Up Slowly:** Bring the other leg in (you might straddle the boat for a second). Keep your weight low. Carefully shift your weight to sit down *slowly* onto the seat.

    ![Placeholder: Photo showing swinging leg over and sitting up](image-link-placeholder)
* **Regain Control:**
    * Immediately get control of the oar handles. Lift them slightly to keep the blades flat on the water for stability.
    * Take a moment to catch your breath and get fully situated on the seat. The boat will likely have some water in it ‚Äì this is normal.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Avoid pulling *down* on the far rigger/gunwale when trying to get in ‚Äì this will likely just pull the boat over on top of you. Focus on kicking *up* and getting your hips onto the near side.
