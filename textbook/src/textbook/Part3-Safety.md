# Part 3: Safety

## Chapter 6: On-Water Safety Protocols

Safety is the foundation of enjoyable rowing. This chapter outlines the essential protocols and awareness needed *before* you even launch and while you are on the water. Adhering to these practices ensures not only your safety but the safety of everyone sharing the river. *Refer to the official [AARC Safety Rules (PDF)](/aarc_lts/src/AARC_Safety_Rules.pdf) for complete details.*

### Weather and Water Condition Assessment

Conditions on the water can change quickly. Always assess the weather and water before launching. Your coaches are responsible for making the final call on whether practice proceeds, but every rower should be aware of these factors:

* **Weather Forecast:** Check for predicted wind speed/direction, thunderstorms, temperature changes, and precipitation.
* **Lightning & Thunder:** Rowing activities **must** be postponed or curtailed if lightning is seen or thunder is heard within the **previous 30 minutes**.
* **Wind:** High winds (e.g., sustained over 12 mph or gusts over 15 mph) can make rowing difficult and dangerous, especially for beginners. Whitecaps on the water are a sign of high wind.
* **Temperature (Air & Water):** Cold water significantly increases the risk of hypothermia if you capsize. Dress appropriately in layers. Your coaches follow specific temperature guidelines, especially regarding the use of singles and doubles in early spring or late fall.
* **Visibility:** Fog or heavy rain can severely reduce visibility, making it hard to see obstacles or other boats. Avoid rowing if visibility is less than ~100 meters.
* **River Conditions:** Check for strong currents (especially after heavy rain) and debris (logs, branches) in the water.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Never underestimate the weather. If in doubt, stay ashore. Your coach has the final authority to cancel practice due to unsafe conditions. *See the website's [Weather Guidelines for Rowers](/aarc_lts/course_materials/learner/safety/Weather_Guidelines.html) for more information.*

### Essential Equipment Checks

Before every row, perform a quick safety inspection of your boat and oars. This takes only a minute and can prevent serious problems.

#### Boat Checks:

* **Bow Ball:** Ensure it's securely attached and not damaged. This is a critical safety feature.
* **Hull Integrity:** Look for any visible cracks or damage to the boat's body.
* **Riggers:** Check that riggers are securely bolted to the boat.
* **Oarlocks/Gates:** Make sure the gates close properly and hold the oar securely.
* **Foot Stretchers:** Confirm they are adjusted correctly for you and securely fastened.
* **Heel Restraints:** **Crucially important!** Check that the straps limiting heel lift are functional and allow quick foot release in case of capsize.
* **Seat & Tracks:** Ensure the seat slides smoothly and tracks are clear.

#### Oar Checks:

* **Collars/Buttons:** Verify they are securely fastened and correctly positioned.
* **Blades/Shafts:** Check for any cracks or significant damage.

**Reporting Issues:** If you find *any* problems with the equipment, **do not use it**. Report the issue immediately to your coach and make an entry in the boat logbook.

### Following Traffic Patterns

As discussed in Part 2, Chapter 5, knowing and adhering to the established river traffic pattern is vital for safety. Remember the key principles:

* Stay to the **starboard (right)** side of the river.
* Pass other boats safely (usually towards the center of the river).
* Turn appropriately at designated points.
* **Look around constantly** (every 3-5 strokes).

Following these rules prevents collisions and ensures predictable movement for all water users. *Consult the [River Traffic Guide](/aarc_lts/course_materials/learner/safety/River_Traffic_Guide.html) for a detailed explanation.*

### Communication: Commands and Signals

Clear communication on the water is essential.

* **Coach Signals:** Your coach will use voice commands, a megaphone, or whistle signals. Common whistle signals include:
    * One blast: Get attention / Stop rowing.
    * Multiple blasts: Emergency / Hazard.
* **Rowing Commands:** Learn basic commands your coach might use, such as:
    * "Way Enough" (or "Weigh Enough"): Stop rowing.
    * "Hold Water": Stop the boat quickly by squaring blades in the water.
    * "Let it Run": Stop rowing and glide.
* **Distress Signal:** The universal signal for distress on the water is repeatedly raising and lowering both arms overhead.
* **Verbal Communication:** Keep chatter minimal while rowing to ensure commands can be heard.

üí° **Tip:** Always prioritize safety. It is the responsibility of every person on the water to look out for themselves and others. If you feel unsafe for any reason, communicate this to your coach immediately.

## Chapter 6A: Boathouse Rules and Equipment Care

Proper care and handling of equipment not only extends its lifespan but also ensures it remains in good working condition for everyone. This chapter covers important boathouse etiquette and equipment maintenance responsibilities. *See the detailed [Boathouse Rules and Equipment Care Guide](/aarc_lts/src/Boathouse_Rules_and_Equipment_Care.html) online.*

### General Boathouse Rules

* **Sign Out/In:** Always record your boat usage in the logbook, including any issues encountered.
* **Footwear:** Wear appropriate footwear. No street shoes on the dock or in boats.
* **Quiet Hours:** Respect neighbors by minimizing noise during early morning hours.
* **Security:** Last person leaving ensures doors/gates are locked.
* **Keep Pathways Clear:** Do not block walkways, doorways, or launch areas.

### Equipment Handling and Storage

#### Boat Handling

* **Carrying Boats:** Use proper technique and adequate help. Listen to commands.
* **Using Slings/Stretchers:** Place boats carefully on stretchers for maintenance.
* **Step Ladders:** Use provided ladders for high racks; don't climb racks. Return ladders.

#### Boat Maintenance

1.  **Cleaning the Boat:** Before racking, place on slings and wipe down thoroughly with provided rags/towels.
2.  **Storing the Boat:** Return to original rack position. Align riggers with other boats. Ensure proper support.
3.  **Reporting Issues:** Note issues in logbook. Notify coach/officer immediately for significant damage.

#### Oar Care and Storage

* **Oar Storage:** Return oars to designated racks, blades facing correctly.
* **Oar Cleaning:** Rinse with fresh water if available, especially collars/gates.
* **Oar Handles:** Routinely disinfect after each row for hygiene.
* **Tape Removal:** Remove any tape used on handles completely after your row.

### Considerate Use of Facilities

* **Changing Rooms/Bathrooms:** Keep tidy, remove personal belongings.
* **Trash:** Dispose of waste properly, recycle when possible.
* **Personal Items:** Do not leave valuables unattended.

### Equipment Respect Philosophy

* **Respect Your Future Self:** Care ensures good condition for your next row.

Understanding and practicing these safety protocols and boathouse rules forms the bedrock of responsible rowing. The next chapter addresses a key safety skill: what to do if you capsize.

## Chapter 7: Capsize Recovery: The Flip Test & Self-Rescue

Capsizing, or flipping your boat, might seem daunting, but it's a normal part of learning to scull. This chapter teaches you the most important safety skill: how to get back into your boat safely and confidently after a capsize. You'll practice this under supervision during the "Flip Test."

### Why We Practice the Flip Test

The Flip Test is an intentional, supervised capsize and recovery drill crucial for:

* **Familiarization:** Removes fear of the unknown.
* **Skill Practice:** Learn self-rescue technique without stress.
* **Confidence Building:** Reduces anxiety about capsizing during regular rowing.
* **Safety Requirement:** Essential skill for safe rowing.

üí° **Tip:** Everyone feels awkward during their first flip test! Relax, listen to your coach, and focus on the steps.

### Understanding Capsizing (Briefly)

Capsizing can happen due to balance shifts, technique errors (catching a crab), water conditions, or simply learning. It's usually not dramatic.

### Step-by-Step Self-Rescue Process Summary

If you capsize, follow these steps. Remember, your boat and oars float!

#### 1. Immediate Response

* **Stay Calm:** Breathe.
* **Stay With Your Boat:** Hold onto it for flotation.
* **Manage Your Oars:** Locate oars and keep them nearby.

#### 2. Preparing for Re-entry

* **Right the Shell (If Necessary):** Swim to side, reach across hull, grab far gunwale, gently pull towards you.
    ![Placeholder: Illustration showing how to right an overturned shell](placeholder)
* **Position the Oars (T-Position):** Arrange oars perpendicular to boat, blades flat (feathered) on water, handles overlapped near cockpit. This provides stability.
    ![Placeholder: Diagram showing oars in stable T-Position, blades flat](placeholder)

#### 3. Re-entering the Boat (Side Entry Method)

This technique uses leg power, not arm strength.

* **Position Yourself:** Swim to middle of boat, near riggers. Face shell.
* **Get Your Grip:** Grasp overlapped oar handles (stern-ward hand). Other hand on boat center/gunwale.
    ![Placeholder: Photo showing starting position for re-entry](placeholder)
* **The Kick & Hip Lift:** Key move! Take breath, sink slightly. Execute powerful kick (dolphin/scissor) straight up. Simultaneously, push down on handles/boat. Drive **hips** up onto gunwale/deck. Aim for belly button over edge.
    ![Placeholder: Photo demonstrating the kick and hip lift onto the gunwale](placeholder)
* **The Tummy Flop & Roll:** Once hips/stomach across gunwale, pause briefly. Roll body towards boat.
* **Swing a Leg Over:** Swing far leg *over* hull into cockpit.
* **Sit Up Slowly:** Bring other leg in. Keep weight low. Shift weight carefully onto seat.
    ![Placeholder: Photo showing swinging leg over and sitting up](placeholder)
* **Regain Control:** Immediately control oar handles (lift slightly, keep blades flat). Catch breath. Boat may have water - normal.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Avoid pulling *down* on the far rigger/gunwale. Focus on kicking *up* and getting hips onto the near side.
