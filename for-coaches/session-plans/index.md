# Session Plans

This section provides detailed plans for each of the four Learn to Scull sessions, designed to guide coaches through effective teaching progression.

## Session Resources

- [Program Overview](overview.md) - The overall structure and teaching philosophy
- [Session 1 Plan](session-1.md) - Getting Started (Erg concepts, Equipment, Flip Test, First Strokes, *focus on comfort*)
- [Session 2 Plan](session-2.md) - Hitting the Water - Basic Stroke Sequencing (*gentle application of Pick/Pause concepts*, Feathering)
- [Session 3 Plan](session-3.md) - Learning How to Push (Leg Drive, Steering, Navigation Basics, *focus on continuous rowing*)
- [Session 4 Plan](session-4.md) - Navigation and Working Up River (Integration, Independence, Bridge Passage, *focus on skill application*)

Each session plan includes a detailed timeline, teaching objectives, required equipment, setup instructions, specific activities with timing, common issues to watch for, and assessment criteria. *Ergometer work is presented as optional, and on-water drills are de-emphasized in favor of building comfort and applying concepts through guided practice and continuous rowing.*

These plans provide a consistent teaching framework while allowing flexibility to adapt to the needs and progress of your participants.
