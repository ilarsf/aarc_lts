## Key Coaching Points

### Technique Focus Areas
1. **Integration** - All stroke elements working together, including ratio and rhythm.
2. **Consistency** - Maintaining technique (especially ratio) under fatigue.
3. **Adaptability** - Adjusting to changing conditions, boat types (if applicable).
4. **Independence** - Self-diagnosis, correction, and decision-making for maneuvers (backing, turning, docking).
5. **Decision-making** - Good judgment in navigation, traffic, and safety.

### Common Issues to Address
- Regression to early technical errors
- Hesitancy with bridge navigation
- Inconsistent blade depth
- Rushing catch when tired
- Poor posture maintenance over distance
- Ineffective communication with other boats

### Safety Emphasis Points
- Independent decision-making
- Weather awareness and adaptation
- Traffic pattern adherence
- Bridge navigation protocol
- Launch assistance protocol

## Assessment Considerations
Coaches should evaluate each participant's:
- Overall rowing competence, including ratio and rhythm.
- Independent boat handling (steering, backing, turning, docking).
- Navigation confidence and bridge passage.
- Safety awareness and decision-making.
- Technical improvement over program.

## Post-Session Tasks for Coaches
1. Complete final assessment forms
2. Provide written feedback for each participant
3. Identify participants ready for club membership
4. Recommend appropriate next steps for each rower
5. Document any safety incidents or concerns
6. Collect program evaluation feedback
