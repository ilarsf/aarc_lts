## Session Goals
- Transfer ergometer stroke sequence to on-water rowing, including Pick Drill and Pause Drill elements.
- Establish proper recovery sequence (arms → body → slide) and introduce feathering/squaring.
- Develop basic boat control, balance, and understanding of river traffic basics.
- Master safe launching and landing procedures.
- Coach demonstration of full stroke, feathering/squaring.

## Required Equipment
- Single sculls
- Oars
- Ergometers for warm-up
- Coach's launch
- Communication equipment (whistle/megaphone)
- First aid kit and safety gear
- River traffic pattern map/diagram

## Pre-Session Preparation
1. Set up ergometers for warm-up
2. Prepare boats with proper settings for each participant
3. Check oar collars are properly adjusted
4. Ensure coach's launch is fully equipped
5. Review participant skill notes from Session 1
6. Check weather forecast and water conditions
7. Prepare simplified river traffic diagram for reference

   - Pick Drill Progression (arms-only, arms & body, legs only, legs & body, full slide strokes)
   - Pause Drills (e.g., pause at arms away, pause at body prep) - focus on control and sequencing.
   - Full stroke at low rate (16-18 spm) incorporating feathering/squaring.
- **1:50-2:20** - Skill development:
   - Practice feathering and squaring drills (e.g., feathering in place, continuous feathering).

## Key Coaching Points

### Technique Focus Areas
1. **Recovery Sequence** - Clear distinction between arms-body-slide
2. **Hand Heights** - Level hands, no teeter-totter
3. **Blade Control** - Square/feather timing, clean entry/exit. Introduction to feathering.
4. **Balance** - Finding the balanced point, minimal touching of gunwales
5. **Posture** - Maintaining proper back position through the sequence
6. **Pick Drill & Pause Drills** - Reinforcing correct sequencing and control.

### Common Issues to Address
- Rushing into the catch
- Uneven hand heights
- Death grip on handles
- Delayed feathering
- Dropping hands at catch
- Poor body control on recovery

### Safety Emphasis Points
- Awareness of other boat traffic
- Proper command responses
- Communication between boats
- Weather awareness
- Basic navigation rules

## Assessment Considerations
Coaches should note each participant's:
- Control of recovery sequence
- Balance and boat control
- Safety awareness on water
- Launching and landing technique
- Response to coaching cues

## Post-Session Tasks for Coaches
1. Update participant progress notes
2. Identify any special attention needs for Session 3
3. Note equipment adjustments needed for each participant
4. Send follow-up email with homework resources
5. Log any safety incidents or concerns
