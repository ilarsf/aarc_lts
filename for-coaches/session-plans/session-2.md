# Session 2: Hitting the Water - Basic Stroke Sequencing

<div class="info-box tip">
  <h4>Session Overview</h4>
  <p>This second session transitions participants from ergometer to on-water rowing, applying the stroke sequence (Pick Drill, Pause Drills) learned in Session 1 to the boat environment. The session emphasizes proper recovery sequence (arms → body → slide), introduces feathering/squaring, and develops basic boat control and understanding of river traffic.</p>

## Session Goals
- Transfer ergometer stroke sequence to on-water rowing, focusing on the Pick Drill progression.
- Establish proper recovery sequence (arms → body → slide) using Pause Drills.
- Develop basic boat control, balance, and understanding of river traffic basics.
- Master safe launching and landing procedures with coach demonstration and guidance.
- Learn and practice feathering and squaring the blades.

## Required Equipment
- Single sculls
- Oars
- Ergometers for warm-up
- Coach's launch
- Communication equipment (whistle/megaphone)
- First aid kit and safety gear
- River traffic pattern map/diagram

## Pre-Session Preparation
1. Set up ergometers for warm-up
2. Prepare boats with proper settings for each participant
3. Check oar collars are properly adjusted
4. Ensure coach's launch is fully equipped
5. Review participant skill notes from Session 1
6. Check weather forecast and water conditions
7. Prepare simplified river traffic diagram for reference

## Detailed Session Timeline

### 1. Review and Warm-up (30 minutes)
- **0:00-0:10** - Welcome and Session 1 review
   - Review key learnings from Session 1 (erg drills, flip test, boat handling, equipment care)
   - Address questions from homework
   - Set expectations for today's session: transferring erg skills to water, recovery sequence, feathering.
- **0:10-0:25** - Ergometer technique warm-up (Optional, based on group need)
   - Review Pick Drill progression (arms, arms/body, 1/4 slide, 1/2 slide, full slide) - *Emphasize understanding the sequence rather than drill perfection.*
   - Practice Pause Drills (e.g., pause at hands away, pause at body prep) - *Focus on body awareness and control.*
   - Focus on smooth transitions and "arms-body-slide" recovery sequence.
- **0:25-0:30** - Transition to boathouse floor & Safety Briefing on River Traffic
   - Briefly review basic river traffic rules (e.g., stay to starboard side, between the islands and the big tree / small dock).

### 2. Equipment Preparation & Launching (30 minutes)
- **0:30-0:45** - Equipment assignment and adjustment
   - Proper boat selection
   - Foot stretcher adjustment
   - Oar selection and adjustment
   - Learning "oars down first" procedure (if applicable)
   - Boat sign-out process (if applicable)
   - Safe carrying techniques to the dock (coach demonstration)
- **0:45-1:00** - Launching procedure demonstration and practice
   - Review of dock commands and procedures
   - Step-by-step launching process
   - Individual practice with coach supervision

### 3. On-Water Skill Development (90 minutes, including a short break if needed)
- **1:00-1:40** - First Skills Focus: Pick Drill & Pauses
   - Row from dock to practice area, focusing on initial stability and light strokes.
   - Coach Demo: Full stroke on water, feathering and squaring blades.
   - Gentle application of Pick Drill progression on water (arms only, arms & body, 1/4 slide, etc.) - *Focus on comfort and basic execution, not strict drill adherence.*
   - Gentle application of Pause Drills (pause at hands away, pause at body prep) on water. - *Focus on boat stability and sequencing feel.*
   - Applying recovery sequencing on water: "arms away, body over, then slide".
   - Basic turning practice (as introduced in Session 1).
- **1:40-2:20** - Second Skills Focus: Feathering & Continuous Rowing
   - Introduction to feathering, focusing on gentle wrist movements and blade awareness. *Avoid complex feathering drills; aim for basic understanding and execution.*
   - Practice basic sequencing: legs-body-arms for the drive.
   - Focus on control and awareness, linking strokes.
   - Building comfort with the unstable boat.
   - Coach feedback on common errors and corrections.
- **2:20-2:30** - Return to dock preparation
   - Review landing procedure
   - Practice approaching the dock

### 4. Dock Landing Practice (30 minutes)
- **2:30-3:00** - Individual landing practice
   - Coach demonstration
   - Each participant practices landing
   - Provide individual feedback
   - Multiple attempts if needed

### 5. Conclusion and Next Steps (30 minutes)
- **3:00-3:10** - Equipment storage and care
   - Proper boat handling
   - Cleaning and storage (rinsing boats and oars)
   - Reporting any issues
- **3:10-3:20** - Session debrief
   - Group discussion of challenges
   - Celebration of achievements
   - Key learning points
- **3:20-3:30** - Preview of Session 3 and homework
   - What to expect in Session 3
   - Assigned videos and readings
   - Self-practice suggestions if applicable

## Key Coaching Points

### Technique Focus Areas
1. **Recovery Sequence** - Clear distinction between arms-body-slide
2. **Hand Heights** - Level hands, no teeter-totter
3. **Blade Control** - Square/feather timing, clean entry/exit. Introduction to feathering.
4. **Balance** - Finding the balanced point, minimal touching of gunwales
5. **Posture** - Maintaining proper back position through the sequence
6. **Sequencing and Control** - Reinforcing correct sequencing and boat control through guided practice, rather than intensive drills.

### Common Issues to Address
- Rushing into the catch
- Uneven hand heights
- Death grip on handles
- Delayed feathering
- Dropping hands at catch
- Poor body control on recovery

### Safety Emphasis Points
- Awareness of other boat traffic
- Proper command responses
- Communication between boats
- Weather awareness
- Basic navigation rules

## Assessment Considerations
Coaches should note each participant's:
- Control of recovery sequence
- Balance and boat control
- Safety awareness on water
- Launching and landing technique
- Response to coaching cues

## Post-Session Tasks for Coaches
1. Update participant progress notes
2. Identify any special attention needs for Session 3
3. Note equipment adjustments needed for each participant
4. Send follow-up email with homework resources
5. Log any safety incidents or concerns
