### Common Issues to Address
- Rushing into the catch
- Uneven hand heights
- Death grip on handles
- Delayed feathering
- Dropping hands at catch
- Poor body control on recovery

### Safety Emphasis Points
- Awareness of other boat traffic
- Proper command responses
- Communication between boats
- Weather awareness
- Basic navigation rules

## Assessment Considerations
Coaches should note each participant's:
- Control of recovery sequence
- Balance and boat control
- Safety awareness on water
- Launching and landing technique
- Response to coaching cues

## Post-Session Tasks for Coaches
1. Update participant progress notes
2. Identify any special attention needs for Session 3
3. Note equipment adjustments needed for each participant
