    - [ ] Introduction to coaches and fellow participants.
    - [ ] Essential safety protocols (on-land and on-water).

    - *Coach Instruction: "We'll start on the rowing machines, or ergometers, to learn the basic stroke."*
    - [ ] Basic rowing terminology (recap or introduce).
    - [ ] Setting up the ergometer (damper, foot straps).
    - [ ] **Stroke Sequence Demonstration:** Catch, Drive, Finish, Recovery.
        - *Coach Demo: Clearly demonstrate each phase. Emphasize posture and correct sequence: Legs, Body, Arms on the drive; Arms, Body, Legs on the recovery.*

    - [ ] Bow, Stern, Port, Starboard
        - *Coach Demo: Point to each. Mnemonic: "Port and Left have four letters."*
    - [ ] Hull, Deck, Cockpit, Seat, Foot stretchers, Oarlocks (Gates)
        - *Coach Demo: Indicate each part. Explain the function of the foot stretcher and oarlocks briefly.*
    - [ ] Oar: Handle, Shaft, Sleeve, Collar, Blade (Spoon, Back)
        - *Coach Demo: Show an oar. Explain how the collar sits in the oarlock. Differentiate spoon and back of the blade.*
- **Carrying & Launching:**
    - *Coach Instruction: "Sculling shells are fragile and need to be handled with care. We'll practice this together."*
    - [ ] Demonstrate and practice safe lifting and carrying techniques.
        - *Coach Demo: Show lifting from slings/racks (e.g., by saxboards or designated lift points), emphasizing communication ("Ready? Up!"). Explain weight distribution.*
        - *Coach Action: Supervise participants in small groups carrying a boat. Correct grips and posture.*
    - [ ] Demonstrate and practice launching and landing the boat.
        - *Coach Demo: Show how to approach the water, place the boat gently, and secure it at the dock.*

    - [ ] Finding a balanced position.
        - *Coach Instruction: "Feel how the boat responds to your movements. Small, controlled shifts are key."*
        - *Coach Demo: Show a stable, relaxed posture, hands lightly on oar handles (if in boat), eyes looking ahead.*
    - [ ] Oar handling: gripping, feathering, squaring.
        - *Coach Instruction: "Let's learn how to hold and move the oars."*
        - *Coach Demo: Show correct grip (fingers and thumbs, not a fist), hand spacing. Demonstrate feathering (oars flat) and squaring (oars vertical) motion with wrists and forearms. Use cues like "thumbs to chest to feather, knuckles up to square."*
        - *Coach Action: Participants practice in the boat at the dock. Check each participant's grip and motion.*
    - [ ] Basic body posture.
        - *Coach Demo: Show upright posture, slight lean forward from hips (body prep), shins vertical (if demonstrating catch position briefly).*
        - *Coach Instruction: "Sit tall, shoulders relaxed, core engaged."*

        - *Coach Instruction: "Start with just your arms, drawing the handles towards your body. Then, let's add a gentle swing from the hips. We'll try the 'Pick Drill' components." Keep it simple; full slide comes later on water.*
        - *Coach Action: Provide verbal cues and support. Keep participants close to the dock.*
    - [ ] Steering basics (if applicable, with coach guidance).
        - *Coach Instruction: "Slightly more pressure on one oar will turn the boat. We'll work on this more later."*

- **Flip Test (Capsize Drill):**
    - *Coach Instruction: "A critical part of water safety is knowing what to do if you capsize. We'll practice this now in a controlled way."*
    - [ ] Safety briefing: Emphasize staying calm, staying with the boat.
        - *Coach Action: Ensure PFDs are correctly worn. Explain the procedure clearly before entering the water. Have safety personnel ready (e.g., assistant in water or on launch).*
    - [ ] **Demonstration (if possible/appropriate):** Coach or experienced helper demonstrates capsize and re-entry or procedure.
    - [ ] Supervised capsize.
        - *Coach Action: Guide participant through the capsize.*
    - [ ] Managing oars.
        - *Coach Instruction: "Keep track of your oars; they can help with stability."*
    - [ ] Righting the shell (if it inverts).
    - [ ] Positioning oars for re-entry (perpendicular or other stable method).
    - [ ] Re-entering the boat.
        - *Coach Action: Provide clear instructions and physical assistance if needed. Focus on using legs and maintaining a low center of gravity.*
    - [ ] If re-entry is difficult, practice swimming the boat to shore/dock.
        - *Coach Instruction: "If you can't get back in, stay with your boat and kick to bring it to safety."*

## Common Issues & Solutions
- **Fear/Nervousness:**
    - [ ] Reassure, start slowly, ensure PFDs are worn correctly.
    - *Coach Action: Maintain a calm, positive demeanor. "It's normal to feel a bit wobbly at first. Everyone does!" Check PFD fit individually.*
- **Difficulty Balancing:**
    - [ ] Emphasize relaxed grip, looking ahead, small movements.
    - *Coach Instruction: "Try to keep your head up and look towards the horizon. Let your hips absorb the boat's movement. Relax your grip on the oars."*
    - [ ] Use wider, more stable boats if available.
    - *Coach Action: If a participant is struggling significantly, consider a brief switch to a more stable craft if possible, or provide more hands-on stabilization.*
- **Incorrect Grip:**
    - [ ] Demonstrate correct hand spacing and grip pressure.
    - *Coach Action: Physically adjust their hands if necessary (ask permission first). "Imagine you're holding a baby bird â€“ firm but gentle."*
- **Oar Handling Clumsiness:**
    - [ ] Break down feathering/squaring into simple steps. Practice on land first.
    - *Coach Demo: Use an oar on land or a dock edge to re-demonstrate the wrist/forearm motion. "Roll the handle with your fingers."*

## Post-Session Checklist
- [ ] Boats and oars properly stored.
    - *Coach Action: Supervise and assist. **Demonstrate and have participants practice proper cleaning and storage procedures for boats and oars.** Reinforce correct storage.*
- [ ] Equipment checked for damage.
    - *Coach Action: Do a quick visual inspection of boats and oars used.*
- [ ] Participants debriefed, questions answered.
    - *Coach Instruction: "Great job today, everyone! What was one thing you learned or found interesting? Any questions?"*
- [ ] Next session previewed.
    - *Coach Instruction: "Next time, we'll build on this and start working more on the full stroke on the water."*
- [ ] **Homework/Review Suggested:**
    - *Coach Instruction: "To help remember what we learned, you can review the Session 1 materials online, including the terminology and videos. Think about the stroke sequence we practiced on the ergs."*

## Coach Notes
*(Space for notes on individual participants, group progress, incidents, equipment issues, **erg performance, flip test observations** etc.)*
