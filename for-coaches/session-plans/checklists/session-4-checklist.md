# Session 4 Checklist: Navigation, Independence, and Next Steps

## Pre-Session Checklist
- [ ] Review notes from Session 3, particularly individual progress, confidence, and specific skills needing reinforcement.
    - *Coach Action: Identify who is ready for bridge passage and who would benefit more from the skills circuit. Plan group divisions.*
- [ ] Equipment ready: boats (various types if introducing), oars, slings, safety launch fully equipped (gas, PFDs, throw rope, first aid, radio/phone).
    - *Coach Action: Ensure boats are appropriate for planned activities (stable for skills, potentially sleeker for more confident rowers). Check steering components on all boats.*
- [ ] Weather and water conditions checked â€“ prioritize safety. Have a contingency plan for poor conditions (e.g., land-based session, erg work, video review).
    - *Coach Action: Be conservative. If conditions are marginal for on-water, especially bridge passage, modify the session. Check for regattas or other events.*
- [ ] Define a safe rowing area/pattern for the session, including skills circuit stations and route for bridge group.
    - *Coach Action: Clearly explain the boundaries. Use buoys or landmarks. Brief any assistant coaches on the plan and their roles.*
- [ ] Prepare rower assessment forms/criteria if formal assessment is part of this session.
- [ ] Have information ready on next steps (club membership, further programs, video review opportunities).

## Session Objectives Checklist
- [ ] Participants can integrate all previously learned skills, demonstrating effective ratio and rhythm.
- [ ] Participants develop confidence in river navigation, including docking and, for some, bridge passage.
- [ ] Participants can perform backing and turning maneuvers effectively.
- [ ] Participants achieve a degree of independent sculling capability and understand differences between boat types.
- [ ] Participants complete a skills assessment (formal or informal) and receive feedback.
- [ ] Participants are informed about post-program pathways and video review opportunities.

## Key Teaching Points & Activities

- **Review & Session Plan (On Land):**
    - *Coach Instruction: "Welcome to our final session! Today we'll integrate everything, focus on navigation, and discuss your next steps in rowing."*
    - [ ] Reinforce leg drive, ratio/rhythm concepts.
        - *Coach Action: Briefly review key technical points from Session 3.*
    - [ ] Review navigation rules (especially for local water body), docking, and backing procedures.
        - *Coach Instruction: "Remember the traffic pattern, how to look around, and the calls for stopping and turning."*
    - [ ] Outline Day 4 activities: skills circuit and/or bridge passage, group division.
        - *Coach Action: Explain how the groups will work and the objectives for each.*
    - [ ] Introduction to different boat types (e.g., trainers, racers) and their characteristics (stability, speed, handling).

    - [ ] Standard boat preparation with attention to steering components.
    - [ ] Double-checking all equipment.
    - [ ] Supervised launching with minimal assistance.
        - *Coach Action: Observe launching. Encourage participants to help each other and problem-solve minor issues.*

- **Warm-up & Group Division (On Water):**
    - *Coach Instruction: "Let's do a short warm-up row near the boathouse. Focus on good rhythm and balance."*
    - [ ] Short row near boathouse.
    - [ ] Assess individual control/confidence.
        - *Coach Action: Observe scullers during warm-up to confirm group placements or make adjustments.*
    - [ ] Form skill-based groups:
        - [ ] "Bridge Ready" group (for upriver row with bridge passage).
        - [ ] "Skills Development" group (for skills circuit).
        - *Coach Instruction: "Okay, [names] you'll be with me for the bridge row. [Names], you'll start with [assistant coach/skills circuit]. We may switch later."*

- **Group-Specific On-Water Session (Allow for a mid-session break/switch):**

    - **Bridge Ready Group:**
        - *Coach Instruction: (To Bridge Group) "Our goal is to navigate upriver, pass under the bridge safely, and return. Focus on maintaining your course, looking around, and communicating if needed."*
        - [ ] Guided upriver row with bridge passage.
            - *Coach Action: Lead the group, pointing out landmarks, potential hazards, and correct lines through bridge arches. Maintain radio contact if other coaches are on the water.*
            - *Coach Instruction: "Eyes up, check clearance as we approach the bridge. Hold your course through the arch. No passing under the bridge."*
        - [ ] Focus on navigation, traffic patterns, and maintaining ratio/rhythm.
        - [ ] Build endurance with longer continuous rowing.
        - [ ] Practice docking upon return.
            - *Coach Action: Supervise docking, offering tips for approach and control.*

    - **Skills Development Group / Skills Circuit:**
        - *Coach Instruction: (To Skills Group) "We're going to work through a few stations to sharpen specific skills. Focus on quality in each drill."*
        - [ ] Focused skill refinement stations (Skills Circuit):
            - [ ] **Backing Drill:** (*Coach Demo: Show controlled backing, looking over shoulder.* *Coach Instruction: "Push the oars gently, look where you're going. Try to back in a straight line."*)
            - [ ] **Turning:** Pivot turns, wide turns. (*Coach Demo: Show pivot turn using one oar forward, one back; and wide turn with more pressure on one side.* *Coach Instruction: "For a pivot turn, one oar pushes, one pulls. For a wide turn, use more pressure on your outside oar."*)
            - [ ] **Docking Practice:** Approach, stop, depart. (*Coach Action: Set up a safe docking area. Provide feedback on approach angle and speed.*)
            - [ ] **Continuous Rowing:** Focus on ratio, rhythm, and boat feel. (*Coach Instruction: "Let's do a short piece focusing on that 2:1 or 3:1 ratio. Feel the boat run out between strokes."*)
            - [ ] **Technical Exercises (as needed):** e.g., square blades for balance, pause drills for sequencing.
        - [ ] Emphasis on "Consistent rhythm" and boat feel.

    - [ ] Program completion discussion.
    - [ ] Skills assessment feedback (provide individual feedback based on observations).
        - *Coach Action: Offer positive reinforcement and 1-2 specific areas for each rower to focus on. If formal assessments were done, share results constructively.*
    - [ ] Discuss post-program pathways: club membership, other programs, independent sculling guidelines.
        - *Coach Action: Have flyers or links ready. Explain how to join the club, sign up for intermediate programs, or get certified for independent boat use.*
    - [ ] Information on video review sessions or further coaching.
        - *Coach Instruction: "We offer video analysis sessions which are a great way to get detailed feedback on your technique. Ask a coach for details."*
    - [ ] Answer any remaining questions.
    - [ ] Collect feedback on the Learn to Scull program.
        - *Coach Action: Provide a simple feedback form or ask for verbal feedback.*

## Common Issues & Solutions
- **Navigation Errors/Bridge Apprehension:**
    - [ ] Clear pre-briefing on bridge transit. Lead by example. Maintain calm.
    - *Coach Instruction: "The bridge can seem intimidating, but by taking the correct arch and maintaining your course, it's straightforward. Follow me, and keep your eyes up."*
    - [ ] For skills group, use buoys to simulate tight passages.
- **Inconsistent Skills in Circuit:**
    - [ ] Break down complex maneuvers. Offer individual coaching at each station.
    - *Coach Action: If someone is struggling with backing, for example, spend a few extra minutes with them, simplifying the movement.*
- **Fatigue Leading to Poor Technique during longer pieces:**
    - [ ] Encourage breaks. Remind that it's okay to row shorter distances initially.
    - *Coach Instruction: "Listen to your body. It's better to take a short break and maintain good form than to push through with bad technique."*
    - [ ] Focus on efficiency over power when tired.
- **Uncertainty about "Next Steps":**
    - [ ] Clearly outline opportunities for continued rowing (e.g., club membership, supervised sessions, open sculling times).
    - *Coach Action: Have information ready about how participants can continue sculling at the club or elsewhere. Be enthusiastic about their continued participation.*

## Post-Session Checklist
- [ ] All participants safely off the water and boats stored correctly.
- [ ] Final debrief completed, questions answered.
- [ ] Resources for continued learning and practice provided.
- [ ] Feedback on the LTS program collected.

## Coach Notes
*(Space for final assessment notes for each participant, recommendations for their continued sculling development, any overall program feedback or improvements for next time. Note who successfully navigated the bridge, who excelled in skills circuit, etc.)*
