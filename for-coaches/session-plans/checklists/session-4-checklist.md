# Session 4 Checklist: Navigation, Integration & Assessment

This checklist is for the final session, Session 4, focusing on skill integration, navigation (including bridge passage), and a skills assessment. It aligns with the Session 4 Plan and `for-learners/learning-journey/session-4.md`.

## Pre-Session
- [ ] Review participant notes from Session 3 (leg drive, steering, confidence levels).
- [ ] Check weather and water conditions meticulously. Confirm bridge passage is safe if planned.
- [ ] Prepare boats, oars, PFDs. Ensure equipment is in excellent condition for assessment.
- [ ] Coach launch ready: fuel, safety gear, communication, first aid, assessment sheets/clipboard.
- [ ] Clearly define the on-water route, including navigation points and bridge passage strategy.
- [ ] Finalize skills assessment criteria and tasks. Ensure they are clear and observable.
- [ ] Prepare information on next steps/novice programs for participants.
- [ ] Review Session 4 Plan and key objectives.

## I. Warm-up & Review (Approx. 20 mins)
- [ ] Welcome, congratulate on reaching the final session.
- [ ] Briefly review key learnings from Session 3 (leg drive, steering, continuous rowing, navigation basics).
- [ ] Q&A on any lingering questions from previous sessions.
- [ ] Outline Session 4 objectives:
    - [ ] Consolidating all learned skills (stroke technique, boat handling, feathering).
    - [ ] Practicing independent navigation and river traffic rules.
    - [ ] Safely executing bridge passage (if applicable).
    - [ ] Building confidence for independent rowing.
    - [ ] Conducting a skills assessment.
    - [ ] Discussing next steps in rowing.
- [ ] Land-Based Dynamic Warm-up & Q&A.
    - [ ] Focus on full-body movements, preparing for a longer row.
    - [ ] Review the planned on-water route, highlighting navigation points, bridge arches, and any potential hazards.
    - [ ] Briefly explain the structure of the skills assessment.

## II. Equipment & Launch (Approx. 20 mins)
- [ ] **Independent Equipment Check & Setup:**
    - [ ] Participants independently check and set up their assigned boats and oars.
    - [ ] Coaches observe, offering minimal assistance to encourage self-reliance.
    - [ ] Final check of PFDs and safety awareness.
- [ ] **Supervised Launch:**
    - [ ] Participants launch boats, applying all learned dock procedures.
    - [ ] Emphasize awareness of other dock users and water traffic.

## III. On-Water Session - Navigation & Integration (Approx. 70 mins)
- [ ] **Warm-up Row & Skill Refinement:**
    - [ ] Gentle rowing away from the dock, gradually increasing intensity.
    - [ ] Incorporate brief drills from Sessions 1-3 as needed to polish specific skills (e.g., pause drills for composure, pick drill for sequence, steering exercises).
- [ ] **Continuous Rowing with Navigation Focus:**
    - [ ] Guide participants on the planned route upriver.
    - [ ] Emphasize maintaining course, consistent technique, and awareness of surroundings.
    - [ ] Coach provides targeted feedback on technique, navigation, and boat handling.
    - [ ] Encourage participants to make their own steering decisions, with coach oversight.
- [ ] **Bridge Passage Practice (If Applicable & Safe):**
    - [ ] Approach the bridge, discuss strategy: chosen arch, current effects, visibility.
    - [ ] Execute passage one by one or in small, spaced groups.
    - [ ] Coach positioned for best observation and safety.
    - [ ] Discuss the passage afterward: what went well, what could be improved.
- [ ] **General River Traffic & Hazard Awareness:**
    - [ ] Point out and discuss interactions with other water users.
    - [ ] Practice maneuvers for avoiding obstacles or other boats (e.g., controlled stop, course adjustment).

## IV. Skills Assessment & Cool Down (Approx. 40 mins)
- [ ] **Skills Assessment Execution:**
    - [ ] Move to a designated safe area for the assessment tasks.
    - [ ] Clearly explain each task before participants attempt it.
    - [ ] Observe and record performance for each participant on predefined criteria. Tasks may include:
        - [ ] **Task 1: Controlled Stop:** From steady rowing, come to a complete stop within a reasonable distance.
        - [ ] **Task 2: Pivot Turn:** Execute a 360-degree pivot turn (or two 180-degree turns).
        - [ ] **Task 3: Backing:** Back the boat in a straight line for a short distance (e.g., 2-3 boat lengths).
        - [ ] **Task 4: Steady State Rowing:** Demonstrate good form, control, and consistent bladework for a set distance or time (e.g., 200-500m or 2-3 minutes).
        - [ ] **Task 5: Simulated Emergency Stop/Obstacle Avoidance:** Respond to a verbal cue to stop quickly or steer sharply to avoid a (simulated) object.
        - [ ] **Task 6 (If applicable):** Safe approach and passage through a bridge arch (can be part of the main row).
- [ ] **Cool-Down Row:**
    - [ ] Gentle, relaxed rowing back to the dock after assessment tasks are complete.
    - [ ] Encourage focus on smooth, efficient movements.

## V. Landing, Equipment Care & Debrief (Approx. 30 mins)
- [ ] **Supervised Landing & Equipment Care:**
    - [ ] Participants land boats safely.
    - [ ] Thoroughly clean and properly store all boats and oars.
    - [ ] Ensure boathouse/storage area is left tidy.
- [ ] **Session Debrief, Assessment Review & Next Steps:**
    - [ ] Congratulate participants on completing the course.
    - [ ] General positive feedback on the session and overall progress.
    - [ ] Briefly discuss general observations from the skills assessment (common strengths, areas for continued practice). Detailed individual feedback may be given separately or via notes.
    - [ ] **Provide Clear Guidance on Next Steps:**
        - [ ] Information on novice programs, supervised sculling sessions, or other club pathways.
        - [ ] How to continue developing their skills.
        - [ ] Importance of ongoing safety awareness.
    - [ ] Answer any final questions.
    - [ ] Distribute any certificates or completion materials (if applicable).

## Post-Session
- [ ] Complete individual assessment notes for each participant.
- [ ] Ensure all equipment is secure and boathouse is in order.
- [ ] Report any incidents or significant observations to the program coordinator.
- [ ] Follow up with participants regarding next steps if promised.
