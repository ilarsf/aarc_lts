# Session 2 Checklist: Hitting the Water - Basic Stroke Sequencing

This checklist supports coaches in delivering Session 2, focusing on transferring erg skills to the water, introducing Pick/Pause Drills, and basic boat handling. It aligns with the Session 2 Plan and `for-learners/learning-journey/session-2.md`.

## Pre-Session
- [ ] Review participant notes from Session 1.
- [ ] Check weather and water conditions; adjust plan if necessary (e.g., wind, current).
- [ ] Prepare boats, oars, and PFDs for all participants.
- [ ] Ensure coach launch is ready (fuel, safety gear, communication).
- [ ] Set out any necessary markers or buoys if used for drills.
- [ ] Review Session 2 Plan and key objectives.
- [ ] Continue organizing graduation gifts/merchandise.

## I. Review and Warm-up (Approx. 20 mins)
- [ ] Welcome, recap Session 1 (erg basics, flip test, equipment handling).
- [ ] Q&A on Session 1 topics.
- [ ] Outline Session 2 objectives:
    - [ ] Transferring Pick Drill sequence to the water.
    - [ ] Learning Pause Drills for recovery sequence.
    - [ ] Introduction to feathering and squaring blades.
    - [ ] Basic boat control (e.g., one-armed turns).
    - [ ] Safe launching and landing procedures.
- [ ] Land-based dynamic warm-up, focusing on rowing-specific movements.
- [ ] Optional: Brief erg warm-up (5-10 mins) reinforcing stroke sequence if conditions warrant or participants need a refresher.

## II. Equipment Preparation & Launching (Approx. 25 mins)
- [ ] **Participant-led Equipment Setup (Supervised):**
    - [ ] Participants select/are assigned boats and oars.
    - [ ] Adjust foot stretchers (reiterate importance for connection).
    - [ ] Check oar buttons/collars are secure and correctly positioned.
    - [ ] Review how to place oars in oarlocks and secure gates.
- [ ] **Launching Procedure Briefing & Demo:**
    - [ ] Review club-specific launching protocols (e.g., "oars down to the water," traffic patterns on the dock).
    - [ ] Demonstrate carrying boat to water (reinforce from Session 1).
    - [ ] Demonstrate safe entry into the boat (reinforce from Session 1).
    - [ ] Explain importance of signing out/in (if applicable).
- [ ] **Supervised Launching:**
    - [ ] Participants launch in small groups or individually, with coach guidance.
    - [ ] Ensure PFDs are correctly worn.

## III. On-Water Skill Development (Approx. 60-70 mins)
- [ ] **Initial Boat Familiarization & Stability:**
    - [ ] Once launched, have participants get a feel for the boat: gentle rocking, finding balance point.
    - [ ] Practice basic sculling (hands only, body rock) away from the dock.
- [ ] **First Skills: Pick Drill on Water (Focus on Sequence & Balance)**
    - [ ] **Arms Only:** Stationary or very gentle movement. Focus on oar control, blade depth (half-buried), and hand heights.
    - [ ] **Arms & Body:** Introduce body swing, maintaining balance. Emphasize connection and posture.
    - [ ] **Quarter Slide (Legs):** Short slide, focusing on leg drive initiation and control.
    - [ ] **Half Slide:** Lengthening the leg drive.
    - [ ] **Full Slide (Full Stroke):** Integrating all components. Focus on rhythm and flow, not power initially.
    - [ ] Provide constant feedback on blade work, posture, and balance.
- [ ] **Second Skills: Pause Drills (Focus on Recovery Sequence & Control)**
    - [ ] **Pause at Arms Away:** Drive, then pause with arms extended. Check hand heights, body prep.
    - [ ] **Pause at Body Over:** From arms away, add body angle forward. Check posture, oar handle heights.
    - [ ] **Pause at Hands & Body Away (Before Slide):** Complete recovery sequence before legs break. Reinforce sequence: Arms -> Body -> Slide.
    - [ ] Perform drills stationary first, then with gentle rowing.
- [ ] **Third Skills: Introduction to Feathering & Squaring**
    - [ ] Explain purpose of feathering (reduce wind resistance, clear water on recovery).
    - [ ] Demonstrate feathering/squaring motion with hands (on land or in boat, stationary).
    - [ ] Practice feathering/squaring while stationary, then with simple arms-only rowing.
    - [ ] Integrate feathering into Pause Drills and then continuous rowing (if ready).
- [ ] **Basic Boat Control & Maneuvering:**
    - [ ] **Stopping the boat:** Squaring blades, gentle back-pressure.
    - [ ] **One-armed turns/wide turns:** Using one oar to turn the boat gently (e.g., port oar to turn starboard, starboard oar to turn port by taking strokes or holding water).
    - [ ] Discuss basic awareness of surroundings (other boats, obstacles).

## IV. Cool Down & Landing (Approx. 15-20 mins)
- [ ] Gentle rowing back to the dock, focusing on relaxed technique.
- [ ] **Supervised Landing:**
    - [ ] Approach dock slowly and with control.
    - [ ] Review safe exit from boat (reinforce from Session 1).
    - [ ] Participants land and secure boats temporarily.

## V. Equipment Care & Debrief (Approx. 20 mins)
- [ ] **Equipment Care:**
    - [ ] Supervise participants in rinsing/wiping boats and oars.
    - [ ] Ensure proper storage of all equipment.
- [ ] **Session Review & Q&A:**
    - [ ] Recap skills covered: Pick Drill on water, Pause Drills, feathering basics, simple turns.
    - [ ] Positive reinforcement and constructive feedback.
    - [ ] Answer participant questions.
- [ ] **Preview Session 3:**
    - [ ] Briefly explain focus of Session 3 (e.g., developing leg drive, steering, navigation basics).
- [ ] Thank participants.

## Post-Session
- [ ] Ensure all equipment is stored correctly and securely.
- [ ] Note participant progress, challenges, and any equipment/safety issues.
- [ ] Communicate with other coaches/coordinator as needed.
