# Session 2 Checklist: Developing the Stroke and Improving Boat Control

## Pre-Session Checklist
- [ ] Review notes from Session 1.
    - *Coach Action: Identify any participants who need extra attention or specific reminders from Session 1 (e.g., flip test comfort, erg sequence).*
- [ ] Equipment ready (boats, oars, PFDs, coaching launch).
    - *Coach Action: Ensure boats are appropriate for developing stroke; slightly more stable is still okay.*
- [ ] Weather and water conditions checked.
    - *Coach Action: Ideal conditions are calm water. If slightly windy, plan drills to utilize or mitigate wind.*
- [ ] Assistant coaches briefed on session focus (if applicable).
    - *Coach Action: Discuss the progression from static to dynamic skills and how to provide feedback.*

## Session Objectives Checklist
- [ ] Participants can demonstrate improved balance and confidence in the boat.
- [ ] **Participants can transfer ergometer stroke sequence (Pick Drill progression) to on-water rowing.**
- [ ] **Participants can establish and demonstrate the proper recovery sequence (arms → body → slide) using Pause Drills on water.**
- [ ] Participants can feather and square oars with more consistency.
- [ ] Participants can maneuver the boat (e.g., stopping, **basic turning, one-armed turns**) and understand **basic river traffic rules (stay starboard).**
- [ ] **Participants can demonstrate safe launching and landing procedures.**
- [ ] Participants understand the importance of looking around for safety.
- [ ] Participants can row short distances with reasonable control.

## Key Teaching Points & Activities
- **Warm-up & Review (On Land/Erg):**
    - *Coach Instruction: "Welcome back! Any questions from Session 1? Let's start with an erg warm-up to reinforce our stroke sequence."*
    - [ ] Brief Q&A about Session 1.
    - [ ] **Ergometer Warm-up:**
        - [ ] Review Pick Drill progression (arms only, arms & body, 1/4 slide, 1/2 slide, full slide).
            - *Coach Demo: Briefly demonstrate each stage on the erg.*
        - [ ] Practice Pause Drills on erg (pause at hands away, pause at body prep).
            - *Coach Demo: Demonstrate pauses, emphasizing correct posture and sequence.*
        - *Coach Instruction: "Focus on smooth transitions and especially that 'arms-body-slide' sequence on the recovery."*
- **Equipment Preparation & Safety Briefing (Transition to Water):**
    - *Coach Instruction: "Let's get ready to go on the water. We'll review how to get oars and boats safely."*
    - [ ] **Procedure for getting oars (e.g., "oars down first" if applicable).**
    - [ ] **Boat sign-out process (if applicable).**
    - [ ] **Coach Demonstration: Safe carrying techniques from racks to dock.**
        - *Coach Action: Supervise participants carrying boats to the dock.*
    - [ ] **Briefing on basic river traffic rules (e.g., stay to starboard side, how to cross, communication).**
        - *Coach Instruction: "Remember, we always stay to the right side of the river, just like driving."*
- **Launching & Dock Procedures:**
    - *Coach Instruction: "Let's review getting the boats launched safely."*
    - [ ] Review dock commands and procedures for launching.
    - [ ] Step-by-step launching process.
    - [ ] Individual practice with coach supervision.
- **On-Water Drills & Technique Development:**
    - *Coach Instruction: "Now we'll apply what we did on the ergs to the water. We'll start with the Pick Drill."*
    - [ ] **Coach Demonstration: Full stroke sequence on water.**
    - [ ] **Pick Drill Progression (On Water):**
        - [ ] Arms only.
        - [ ] Arms & body.
        - [ ] 1/4 slide.
        - [ ] 1/2 slide.
        - [ ] Full slide.
        - *Coach Action: Guide participants through each stage. Provide feedback on balance and blade work.*
    - [ ] **Pause Drills (On Water):**
        - [ ] Pause at hands away.
        - [ ] Pause at body prep (body rocked over).
        - *Coach Instruction: "Focus on that sequence: arms extend, body rocks over, then the slide. These pauses will help."*
    - [ ] **Feathering & Squaring:**
        - *Coach Demo: Demonstrate feathering on recovery and squaring before the catch.*
        - [ ] Practice feathering drill (e.g., feather smoothly after release, square cleanly before entry).
        - *Coach Instruction: "Roll the handles with your fingers. Flat on recovery, vertical for the catch."*
    - [ ] **Continuous Rowing & Linking Strokes:**
        - [ ] Practice basic drive sequence: legs-body-arms.
        - [ ] Focus on control, awareness, and linking strokes smoothly.
        - [ ] Building comfort and balance in the boat.
        - *Coach Action: Provide ongoing feedback on common errors (e.g., rushing slide, incorrect hand levels).*
- **Boat Control Drills (Reinforce & Introduce):**
    - *Coach Instruction: "Now that we can move the boat, let's learn how to steer and stop."*
    - [ ] **Stopping:** Demonstrate and practice using oars to stop.
        - *Coach Demo: Show how to square blades and apply gentle backward pressure to stop the boat.*
        - *Coach Instruction: "To stop, square your blades and let them drag, or push gently backwards."*
    - [ ] **Turning:** Reinforce basic turning (e.g., one oar pressure). **Introduce/practice one-armed turns for gradual adjustments.**
        - *Coach Demo: Show how to use one arm for gentle turns or by varying pressure.*
        - *Coach Instruction: "To turn left, row more with your right oar, or drag your left. Vice-versa to turn right."*
    - [ ] **Backing Down:** Practice rowing backwards for maneuverability.
        - *Coach Demo: Show how to reverse the sculling motion to move the boat backward.*
        - *Coach Instruction: "Push the oar handles away from you at the finish to go backwards."*
    - [ ] **Slalom/Obstacle Course (simple):** If space and conditions allow.
        - *Coach Action: Set up a few buoys or markers. "Let's try to weave through these markers using your new steering skills."*
- **Safety & Awareness:**
    - [ ] Emphasize looking around for safety (every 5-10 strokes).
        - *Coach Instruction: "It's crucial to know what's around you. Look over your shoulder every few strokes, especially before turning."*
    - [ ] **Reinforce river traffic rules and right-of-way concepts.**

## Common Issues & Solutions
- **Rushing the Slide/Recovery:**
    - [ ] Emphasize slow, controlled recovery. "Slow hands, slow slide."
    - *Coach Instruction: "The recovery is your time to relax and prepare for the next stroke. Don't rush towards the catch."*
    - [ ] Drills: Pause at hands away, body rocked over.
        - *Coach Demo: Demonstrate pause drills, emphasizing the distinct positions.*
- **Incorrect Sequencing (e.g., breaking arms early on drive):**
    - [ ] Break down stroke again. Use verbal cues for sequence (legs, body, arms).
    - *Coach Action: If a participant struggles, have them go back to arms-only or arms-and-body to reinforce correct sequence.*
- **Poor Blade Work (missing water, digging too deep):**
    - [ ] Check oarlock height and pitch if consistent issue.
        - *Coach Action: Make minor adjustments if tools and knowledge are available, or note for later.*
    - [ ] Drills: Stationary blade depth practice, focus on oar height at entry/exit.
        - *Coach Instruction: "Aim for the bottom edge of the blade to be just covered at the catch. Keep hands at the same level through the drive."*
- **Difficulty Steering/Controlling Boat:**
    - [ ] Ensure understanding of how oars affect boat direction.
    - *Coach Instruction: "Remember, the boat pivots around the middle. Small adjustments make a big difference."*
    - [ ] Practice in calm water, start with small adjustments.

## Post-Session Checklist
- [ ] **Review dock approach techniques.**
- [ ] **Safe landing practice.**
    - *Coach Action: Supervise docking and landing, providing guidance.*
- [ ] Boats and oars properly stored **(including cleaning procedures).**
    - *Coach Action: Ensure participants are rinsing boats and oars if that's the local custom.*
- [ ] Equipment checked for damage.
- [ ] Participants debriefed, focus on improvements and areas for next session.
    - *Coach Instruction: "Excellent progress today! What felt better by the end of the session? Next time, we'll work on refining this and building more confidence."*
- [ ] Positive reinforcement and encouragement.
    - *Coach Action: Offer specific praise to individuals. "Sarah, your recovery sequence is looking much smoother!"*
- [ ] **Homework/Review Suggested:**
    - *Coach Instruction: "Please review the Session 2 materials online, especially the videos on recovery and feathering. Mentally rehearse the 'arms-body-slide' sequence."*

## Coach Notes
*(Space for notes on individual participants, group progress, specific drills that worked well, challenges, **erg review points, understanding of recovery sequence, feathering progress** etc.)*
