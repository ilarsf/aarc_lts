# Session 3 Checklist: Refining Technique and Building Confidence

## Pre-Session Checklist
- [ ] Review notes from Session 2.
    - *Coach Action: Note participants who are ready for more challenging drills and those who might need more review of basics.*
- [ ] Equipment ready and in good order (oars, slings, boat).
    - *Coach Action: Check oarlock pitches and spans if adjustments were noted as needed previously. Ensure cox boxes (if used) are charged.*
- [ ] Weather and water conditions suitable for more independent practice.
    - *Coach Action: Assess if conditions allow for drills that might be slightly less stable. Have alternatives if too choppy. Check for regattas or other events that might affect water traffic.*
- [ ] Plan for varying skill levels within the group.
    - *Coach Action: Prepare modifications for drills to challenge advanced participants and support those needing more help.*
- [ ] Safety launch ready (gas, PFDs, throw rope, first aid).

## Session Objectives Checklist
- [ ] Participants can execute a smooth and effective pick drill on the water.
- [ ] Participants can perform pause drills (finish, hands away, body prep) with good body position.
- [ ] Participants demonstrate improved blade work (cleaner entries/exits, consistent depth).
- [ ] Participants can row with the outside arm only, demonstrating control.
- [ ] Participants understand basic steering and can execute wider turns.
- [ ] Participants are more aware of their surroundings and other water users.

## Key Teaching Points & Activities

- **Ergometer Warm-up (15-20 minutes):**
    - *Coach Instruction: "Let's start on the ergs to warm up and reinforce some key movements before we hit the water."*
    - [ ] **Warm-up:** Gentle rowing, focusing on rhythm and posture from Session 2.
        - *Coach Action: Observe the group as they warm up. Offer general reminders about posture and flow.*
    - [ ] **Pick Drill on Erg:**
        - *Coach Demo: Demonstrate arms only, arms & body, 1/4 slide, 1/2 slide, 3/4 slide, full slide on the erg.*
        - *Coach Instruction: "We'll go through the pick drill stages. Focus on the sequence: legs, body, arms on the drive; arms, body, legs on the recovery."*
        - [ ] Arms only
        - [ ] Arms and body
        - [ ] Quarter slide
        - [ ] Half slide
        - [ ] Full slide
    - [ ] **Pause Drills on Erg:**
        - *Coach Demo: Demonstrate pauses at the finish, hands away, and body prep on the erg.*
        - *Coach Instruction: "Now, let's practice pausing at key points. At the finish, check your posture. At hands away, ensure your arms are straight. At body prep, feel the core engagement."*
        - [ ] Pause at the finish
        - [ ] Pause at hands away
        - [ ] Pause at body prep (shins vertical)
    - [ ] Address any lingering issues from previous session.
        - *Coach Action: Proactively ask if anyone has questions or issues from Session 2 before moving to the water.*

- **On-Water Session (Focus on Technique Refinement):**
    - *Coach Instruction: "Great job on the ergs. Now let's take those skills to the water. We'll focus on refining your technique and building more confidence in the boat."*
    - [ ] **Equipment Check & Launch:**
        - *Coach Action: Supervise boat handling and oar setup. Remind about safe launching procedures.*
    - [ ] **Warm-up on Water:** Gentle rowing, focusing on balance and rhythm.
        - *Coach Action: Observe initial strokes, provide general feedback.*
    - [ ] **Continuous Pick Drill:**
        - *Coach Demo: Briefly demonstrate the flow of continuous pick drill on water if needed.*
        - *Coach Instruction: "Let's start with a continuous pick drill. Arms only, then add the body, then gradually add slide. Focus on smooth transitions."*
        - [ ] Arms only
        - [ ] Arms and body
        - [ ] Quarter slide
        - [ ] Half slide
        - [ ] Full slide (short pieces)
    - [ ] **Pause Drills (On Water):**
        - *Coach Demo: Clearly demonstrate each pause position on the water. Explain what to focus on during the pause (e.g., balance, posture, hand levels, oar depth).*
        - *Coach Instruction: "We'll row a few strokes, then pause. Hold the position and check your body alignment and oar placement."*
        - [ ] Pause at the finish (check posture, oar handle height)
        - [ ] Pause at hands away (check straight arms, body angle)
        - [ ] Pause at body prep (check body angle, shin angle, core engagement)
    - [ ] **Outside Arm Only Rowing:**
        - *Coach Demo: Show rowing with the inside hand resting on the gunwale or lap, focusing on the outside arm's pull and feathering motion. Emphasize looking over the outside shoulder for steering.*
        - *Coach Instruction: "Focus on your outside arm drawing the oar through and the feathering. This helps with steering and power application. Try to keep the boat set." Alternate sides.*
    - [ ] **Steering and Wider Turns:**
        - *Coach Instruction: "Let's practice steering. Remember, slight pressure on one oar, or slightly more reach, will turn the boat. We'll practice making some wider turns around buoys or landmarks."*
        - *Coach Action: Set a simple course with turns. Observe and guide on how to initiate and complete turns smoothly. Emphasize looking around.*
    - [ ] **Square Blades Rowing (Optional, if time and conditions permit):**
        - *Coach Demo: Demonstrate rowing with blades squared throughout the stroke and recovery.*
        - *Coach Instruction: "If we have time, we can try some square blades. This helps you feel the water pressure and control your blade depth. Keep your wrists flat on the recovery."*
    - [ ] **Feet Out Rowing (Optional, for more advanced/stable participants, calm water):**
        - *Coach Demo: Demonstrate rowing with feet out of the stretchers, emphasizing control and core stability.*
        - *Coach Instruction: "This drill helps you feel the boat\'s balance. Keep movements small and controlled. If you feel unstable, put your feet back in." Use only in very calm water and with close supervision.*

- **Cool Down & Landing:**
    - *Coach Instruction: "Let's cool down with some easy rowing back to the dock. Focus on long, relaxed strokes."*
    - [ ] Gentle rowing, focusing on relaxation and rhythm.
    - [ ] **Docking Practice:**
        - *Coach Demo: If needed, re-demonstrate a controlled approach to the dock.*
        - *Coach Instruction: "Approach the dock slowly and at an angle. Use your oars to stop and pull alongside. Communicate with your partner if in a double."*
    - [ ] **Stretching (On Land):**
        - *Coach Instruction: "Let's do a few stretches to cool down properly."*
        - *Coach Action: Lead a brief stretching session focusing on legs, back, and shoulders.*

## Common Issues & Solutions
- **Losing Technique/Balance during Drills:**
    - [ ] Remind to focus on one or two key points at a time.
    - *Coach Instruction: "If you feel your technique slipping or balance is off, simplify. Pick one thing to focus on for the next 10 strokes, like your hand levels or your posture."*
    - [ ] Break drills into shorter segments with rest/refocus breaks.
- **Inconsistent Blade Depth/Missed Water:**
    - [ ] Focus on hand heights throughout the stroke. "Light hands at the finish, consistent height on recovery."
    - *Coach Instruction: "Are your hands moving up and down during the drive or recovery? Try to keep them level. Ensure you're reaching forward, not down, at the catch."*
    - [ ] Check for tension in shoulders and arms.
        - *Coach Action: Remind participants to relax shoulders. "Shake out your arms if they feel tense."*
- **Difficulty with Steering/Turns:**
    - [ ] Emphasize small, subtle adjustments. Oversteering is common.
    - *Coach Instruction: "Small changes in pressure or reach make a big difference. Look where you want to go."*
    - [ ] Practice in open water before navigating obstacles.

## Post-Session Checklist
- [ ] All equipment accounted for and stored correctly (boats wiped down, oars stored).
- [ ] Debrief with participants: celebrate successes, identify areas for continued practice.
    - *Coach Instruction: "Great work today, especially with the pause drills and steering! What felt better today? What’s still a bit tricky?"*
- [ ] **Homework/Preparation for Session 4:**
    - *Coach Instruction: "For next time, continue to think about the sequence of the stroke – legs, body, arms; then arms, body, legs. If you get a chance, watch some videos of experienced scullers, paying attention to their blade work and rhythm. We'll be putting it all together more next session!"*
- [ ] Discuss any specific safety points or observations from the session.

## Coach Notes
*(Space for notes on individual progress, confidence levels, specific technical points to address next session, any incidents or near-misses, boat/equipment issues.)*
