# Session 3 Checklist: Learning How to Push (Leg Drive & Steering)

This checklist is for Session 3, focusing on developing leg drive, power application, and introducing steering and navigation. It aligns with the Session 3 Plan and `for-learners/learning-journey/session-3.md`.

## Pre-Session
- [ ] Review participant notes from Session 2 (progress on Pick/Pause Drills, feathering).
- [ ] Check weather and water conditions (wind, current, river traffic advisories).
- [ ] Prepare boats, oars, PFDs. Ensure foot stretchers are easily adjustable.
- [ ] Coach launch ready: fuel, safety gear, communication, any teaching aids (e.g., small whiteboard for diagrams).
- [ ] Plan a simple route that allows for continuous rowing and practice of basic navigation/steering.
- [ ] Review Session 3 Plan and key objectives.
- [ ] Finalize organization of graduation gifts/merchandise for Session 4.

## I. Review and Warm-up (Approx. 20 mins)
- [ ] Welcome, recap Session 2 (Pick/Pause Drills on water, feathering, basic boat control).
- [ ] Q&A on Session 2 topics.
- [ ] Outline Session 3 objectives:
    - [ ] Developing effective leg drive and power application.
    - [ ] Understanding and practicing ratio and rhythm.
    - [ ] Introduction to steering principles (varying pressure, basic turns including pivot turns).
    - [ ] Awareness of river traffic patterns and basic navigation rules.
    - [ ] Building towards continuous rowing with some independence.
- [ ] Land-based dynamic warm-up, with emphasis on leg and core activation.
- [ ] Optional: Brief erg warm-up (5-10 mins) focusing on leg drive connection and ratio.

## II. River Geography & Traffic Discussion (Approx. 15 mins)
- [ ] **On Land Briefing:**
    - [ ] Using a map or diagram, discuss the local rowing area: common routes, landmarks, potential hazards (e.g., shallows, buoys, bridge abutments).
    - [ ] Explain basic river traffic patterns/rules of the road (e.g., keep right/starboard side, overtaking procedures, awareness of other water users).
    - [ ] **Steering Techniques Introduction:**
        - [ ] Explain how to steer by varying pressure on oars (more pressure on one side to turn away from it).
        - [ ] Explain how to initiate wider turns by taking more strokes on one side or holding water on the other.
        - [ ] Introduce the concept and execution of a pivot turn (one oar backing, one oar rowing forward) for turning in place.
    - [ ] Discuss importance of looking around (scanning) frequently.

## III. Equipment Prep & Launching (Approx. 20 mins)
- [ ] Participants set up their equipment (boats, oars, foot stretchers) with minimal supervision.
- [ ] Coaches check for safety and correct setup, offering guidance as needed.
- [ ] Review launching procedures; participants launch boats.

## IV. On-Water Session (Approx. 75 mins)
- [ ] **Warm-up on Water:**
    - [ ] Gentle rowing, focusing on skills from Session 2 (Pick Drill, Pause Drills, feathering).
    - [ ] Ensure participants are comfortable and balanced before introducing new concepts.
- [ ] **First Skills: Leg Drive & Ratio (Focus on Power & Rhythm)**
    - [ ] **Leg Drive Emphasis Drills:**
        - [ ] Legs only rowing (from catch, body prepared): Focus on strong, connected leg push.
        - [ ] Legs and body rowing: Adding body swing initiated by leg drive.
        - [ ] Full strokes with emphasis on initiating movement with legs.
    - [ ] **Ratio & Rhythm:**
        - [ ] Explain concept of ratio (drive phase vs. recovery phase timing – e.g., 1:2 or 1:3).
        - [ ] Practice rowing with a focus on a slower, controlled recovery and a powerful drive.
        - [ ] Use calls or counts to help establish rhythm if needed.
    - [ ] Provide feedback on posture, connection, and power application from the legs.
- [ ] **Second Skills: Steering, Turns & Continuous Rowing (Focus on Navigation & Control)**
    - [ ] **Steering Practice:**
        - [ ] While rowing continuously, have participants practice slight course corrections by varying oar pressure.
        - [ ] Practice making wider turns using one oar more than the other.
        - [ ] **Pivot Turns:** Find a safe, open area. Guide participants through executing pivot turns (stationary or slow-moving). Emphasize looking around.
    - [ ] **Navigational Awareness:**
        - [ ] Point out landmarks and discuss their position relative to the desired course.
        - [ ] Encourage participants to look around frequently (every 5-10 strokes) and identify potential traffic or hazards.
        - [ ] Practice maintaining position relative to bank or other boats.
    - [ ] **Continuous Rowing:**
        - [ ] Aim for longer stretches of continuous rowing, integrating leg drive, ratio, feathering, and basic steering.
        - [ ] Coaches provide feedback on overall technique, consistency, and navigational choices.
        - [ ] Introduce simple scenarios, e.g., “row towards that buoy, keeping it on your port side.”

## V. Cool Down & Landing (Approx. 15 mins)
- [ ] Easy rowing back to the dock.
- [ ] Focus on smooth technique and relaxation.
- [ ] Supervised landing, reinforcing good dock procedures.

## VI. Equipment Care & Debrief (Approx. 15 mins)
- [ ] Participants clean and store equipment properly.
- [ ] **Session Review & Q&A:**
    - [ ] Recap skills: leg drive, ratio/rhythm, steering (pressure, turns, pivot turns), basic navigation.
    - [ ] Discuss challenges and successes.
    - [ ] Answer questions.
- [ ] **Preview Session 4:**
    - [ ] Explain focus of Session 4 (e.g., skill integration, longer rows, bridge passage if applicable, skills assessment).
- [ ] Thank participants.

## Post-Session
- [ ] Ensure all equipment is stored correctly.
- [ ] Note participant progress, particularly on leg drive, steering, and confidence.
- [ ] Plan for Session 4, considering individual needs for the assessment.
