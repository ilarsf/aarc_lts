## Session Goals
- Develop effective leg drive, power application, and understand ratio and rhythm.
- Introduce navigation principles, river traffic patterns, and steering by varying pressure.
- Master boat control through turns (pivot turns), varying stroke pressure, and Pause Drills.
- Build confidence through continuous rowing, focusing on technique and rhythm.
- Coach demonstration of full slide rowing with emphasis on leg drive and ratio.

## Required Equipment
- Single sculls
- Oars
- Ergometers for warm-up
- Coach's launch
- River map/traffic pattern diagram
- Communication equipment (whistle/megaphone)
- First aid kit and safety gear

## Pre-Session Preparation
1. Set up ergometers for technique review
2. Prepare visual aids for river traffic patterns
3. Prepare boats with proper settings for each participant
4. Check oar collars and grips
5. Review participant progress notes from Session 2
6. Check weather and water conditions
7. Prepare drill sequence handouts

## Detailed Session Timeline

### 1. Review and Warm-up (30 minutes)
- **0:00-0:10** - Welcome and Session 2 review
   - Recap key learnings (Pick/Pause drills, feathering, basic traffic)
   - Address questions from homework
   - Set expectations for today (leg drive, ratio, steering)
- **0:10-0:25** - Ergometer technique with leg drive focus
   - Proper leg drive mechanics, connection through footplate.
   - Sequencing with proper body angle.
   - Introduction to ratio and rhythm on the erg (e.g., 1:2 drive to recovery count).
   - Drills: Legs only, Legs & Body, Full slide with ratio focus.
- **0:25-0:30** - Transition to boathouse floor

### 2. Navigation and River Traffic Rules (15 minutes)
- **0:30-0:45** - Detailed explanation with visual aids
   - Local river traffic patterns
   - Right of way rules
   - Bridge navigation
   - Communication between boats
   - Emergency procedures

### 3. Equipment Preparation and Launch (30 minutes)
- **0:45-1:00** - Equipment preparations
   - Boat and oar selection
   - Refinement of individual settings
   - Safety check of all equipment
- **1:00-1:15** - Launch sequence
   - Organized and efficient launching
   - Initial stability drill at dock

### 4. On-Water Skill Development (105 minutes)
- **1:15-1:30** - Row to practice area
   - Focus on technique review from Session 2 (feathering, basic steering).
   - Gradual introduction of leg drive. Coach Demo: Full slide rowing with emphasis on leg drive and proper ratio.
- **1:30-2:00** - Drill progression (Leg Drive & Ratio Focus):
   - Leg Drive Progression (Legs only, Legs & Body, Full slide) - focus on power from legs.
   - Pause Drills (e.g., pause at arms away, pause at body prep) to refine sequencing and control, emphasizing ratio.
   - Gradual pressure builds (25%, 50%, 75%) maintaining technique and ratio.
- **2:00-2:30** - Advanced maneuvering and steering practice:
   - Controlled turns: Pivot turns (one backing/one rowing).
   - Steering Drills: Practicing turns using outside arm only / inside arm only / varying pressure.
   - Stopping and starting on command.
   - (Optional) Connection Drills: Wide grip and narrow grip rowing.
- **2:30-3:00** - Continuous rowing with coaching
   - Longer pieces with specific focus points (leg drive, ratio, steering, looking around).
   - Individual feedback on technique.
   - Practice navigating simulated traffic patterns, applying steering techniques.

### 5. Landing and Conclusion (30 minutes)
- **3:00-3:15** - Return to dock and landing practice
   - Refining approach and landing technique
   - Efficient boat handling out of water
- **3:15-3:25** - Equipment storage and care
   - Proper boat washing and storage
   - Oar care and storage
   - Reporting any equipment issues
- **3:25-3:30** - Quick debrief and next steps
   - Brief review of session achievements
   - Preview of final session
   - Assigned homework

## Key Coaching Points

### Technique Focus Areas
1. **Leg Drive** - Power application through legs, not back. Emphasize connection.
2. **Ratio and Rhythm** - Consistent timing between drive and recovery phases.
3. **Catch Timing & Blade Depth** - Clean entry at full reach, consistent depth.
4. **Steering Techniques** - Varying pressure, outside/inside arm for turns, pivot turns.
5. **Core Engagement & Posture** - Connected posture through the drive phase.
6. **Pause Drills** - Reinforcing sequencing, control, and ratio.

### Common Issues to Address
- Rushing the slide into the catch
- Opening the back too early
- Digging too deep with blades
- Insufficient leg compression
- Poor posture at the catch
- Uneven pressure between hands

### Safety Emphasis Points
- Adherence to traffic patterns and looking around frequently.
- Awareness of other water users.
- Proper response to coach commands for steering and stopping.
- Weather awareness and adaptation.
- Emergency stop procedure.

## Assessment Considerations
Coaches should note each participant's:
- Power application development
- Technical adaptation under pressure
- Navigation awareness and rule understanding
- Turning and maneuvering skills
- Overall confidence and progression

## Post-Session Tasks for Coaches
1. Update participant progress notes
2. Identify any special attention needs for final session
3. Begin preliminary assessment for program completion
4. Send follow-up email with homework resources
5. Prepare final session individualized feedback points
