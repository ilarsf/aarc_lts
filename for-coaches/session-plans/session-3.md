## Key Coaching Points

### Technique Focus Areas
1. **Leg Drive** - Power application through legs, not back
2. **Catch Timing** - Clean entry at full reach
3. **Blade Depth** - Consistent and appropriate through drive
4. **Handle Heights** - Maintaining proper height through recovery and drive
5. **Core Engagement** - Connected posture through the drive phase

### Common Issues to Address
- Rushing the slide into the catch
- Opening the back too early
- Digging too deep with blades
- Insufficient leg compression
- Poor posture at the catch
- Uneven pressure between hands

### Safety Emphasis Points
- Adherence to traffic patterns
- Awareness of other water users
- Proper response to coach commands
- Weather awareness and adaptation
- Emergency stop procedure

## Assessment Considerations
Coaches should note each participant's:
- Power application development
- Technical adaptation under pressure
- Navigation awareness and rule understanding
- Turning and maneuvering skills
- Overall confidence and progression

## Post-Session Tasks for Coaches
1. Update participant progress notes
2. Identify any special attention needs for final session
3. Begin preliminary assessment for program completion
4. Send follow-up email with homework resources
5. Prepare final session individualized feedback points
