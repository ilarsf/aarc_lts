## Session Goals
- Develop effective leg drive, power application, and understand ratio and rhythm.
- Learn steering principles, including varying pressure (outside/inside arm, pivot turns), and understand river traffic patterns.
- Master boat control through turns and varying stroke pressure, incorporating Pause Drills for refinement.
- Build confidence through continuous rowing, focusing on technique, rhythm, and looking over shoulder for navigation.
- Coach demonstration of full slide rowing with emphasis on leg drive and proper ratio.

## Required Equipment
- Single sculls
- Oars
- Ergometers for warm-up
- Coach's launch
- River map/traffic pattern diagram
- Communication equipment (whistle/megaphone)
- First aid kit and safety gear

## Pre-Session Preparation
1. Set up ergometers for technique review
2. Prepare visual aids for river traffic patterns
3. Prepare boats with proper settings for each participant
4. Check oar collars and grips
5. Review participant progress notes from Session 2
6. Check weather and water conditions
7. Prepare drill sequence handouts

## Detailed Session Timeline

### 1. Review and Warm-up (30 minutes)
- **0:00-0:10** - Welcome and Session 2 review
   - Recap key learnings (Pick/Pause drills, feathering, basic traffic, recovery sequence)
   - Address questions from homework
   - Set expectations for today (leg drive, ratio, steering, navigation, pivot turns).
- **0:10-0:25** - Ergometer technique with leg drive focus (Optional, based on group need)
   - Proper leg drive mechanics, connection through footplate.
   - Sequencing with proper body angle.
   - Introduction to ratio and rhythm on the erg (e.g., 1:2 drive to recovery count).
   - Drills: Leg Drive Progression (Legs only, Legs & Body, Full slide) with ratio focus. - *Emphasize feeling the connection and sequence, not drill perfection.*
- **0:25-0:30** - Transition to boathouse floor & Session Introduction
   - Reinforcement of sequencing concepts.
   - Introduction of Day 3 focus points.

### 2. River Geography & Traffic (15 minutes)
- **0:30-0:45** - Detailed explanation with visual aids
   - Review of boathouse map and river layout.
   - Explanation of traffic pattern rules.
   - Discussion of steering techniques (varying pressure, pivot turns).
   - Bridge navigation basics.

### 3. Equipment Prep & Launching (30 minutes)
- **0:45-1:00** - Equipment preparations
   - Standard boat preparation with proper checks.
   - Refinement of individual settings.
   - Reinforcement of sign-out procedures.
- **1:00-1:15** - Supervised launching with increasing independence
   - Initial stability drill at dock.

### 4. On-Water Session (105 minutes, including a short break if needed)
- **1:15-1:55** - First Skills Focus: Leg Drive & Ratio
   - Row to practice area, focusing on technique review from Session 2.
   - Optional Coach Demonstration: Full slide rowing with emphasis on leg drive and proper ratio.
   - Practice initiating drive with legs, focusing on feeling the connection from footplate to handle. *Avoid rigid drill formats; encourage exploration of leg pressure.*
   - Connecting legs to handle movement.
   - Looking over shoulder while rowing for navigation practice.
   - Introduction to ratio and rhythm on water.
- **1:55-2:30** - Second Skills Focus: Steering, Turns & Continuous Rowing
   - Continuous rowing focusing on leg drive, maintaining ratio and rhythm.
   - Practice turning techniques: Pivot Turns (one backing/one rowing), varying stroke pressure for steering.
   - Applying varying stroke pressure for steering.
   - Regular navigation practice, aiming for landmarks.
   - *Optional: Gentle Pause Drills (e.g., pause at arms away, pause at body prep) if beneficial for individual understanding of sequencing and control, focusing on boat feel.*
- **2:30-3:00** - Landing & Wrap-up (On Water to Dock)
   - Controlled dock approach with increased independence.

### 5. Conclusion and Next Steps (30 minutes)
- **3:00-3:15** - Equipment storage and care
   - Thorough equipment cleaning (washing boats and oars).
   - Proper storage.
   - Reporting any equipment issues.
- **3:15-3:25** - Session debrief and preview of Session 4
   - Group discussion of challenges and successes.
   - Key learning points (leg drive, steering, ratio).
   - Preview of Session 4 focus (integration, navigation, independence).
- **3:25-3:30** - Homework assignments
   - Review Session 3 materials, videos on leg drive and steering.
   - Mentally rehearse pivot turns and navigation.

## Key Coaching Points

### Technique Focus Areas
1. **Leg Drive** - Power application through legs, not back. Emphasize connection.
2. **Ratio and Rhythm** - Consistent timing between drive and recovery phases.
3. **Catch Timing & Blade Depth** - Clean entry at full reach, consistent depth.
4. **Steering Techniques** - Varying pressure, outside/inside arm for turns, pivot turns.
5. **Core Engagement & Posture** - Connected posture through the drive phase.
6. **Sequencing and Control** - Reinforcing sequencing, control, and ratio through guided practice and continuous rowing, with optional, gentle use of pause concepts for understanding.

### Common Issues to Address
- Rushing the slide into the catch
- Opening the back too early
- Digging too deep with blades
- Insufficient leg compression
- Poor posture at the catch
- Uneven pressure between hands

### Safety Emphasis Points
- Adherence to traffic patterns and looking around frequently.
- Awareness of other water users.
- Proper response to coach commands for steering and stopping.
- Weather awareness and adaptation.
- Emergency stop procedure.

## Assessment Considerations
Coaches should note each participant's:
- Power application development
- Technical adaptation under pressure
- Navigation awareness and rule understanding
- Turning and maneuvering skills
- Overall confidence and progression

## Post-Session Tasks for Coaches
1. Update participant progress notes
2. Identify any special attention needs for final session
3. Begin preliminary assessment for program completion
4. Send follow-up email with homework resources
5. Prepare final session individualized feedback points
