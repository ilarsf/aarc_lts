# Coach Safety Protocols

This guide outlines essential safety protocols specific to coaches in the Learn to Scull Program. Safety is our highest priority - coaches must ensure these protocols are followed in all program activities.

## Coach Safety Responsibilities

Coaches in the Learn to Scull Program have specific safety responsibilities that extend beyond general participant safety rules:

1. **Pre-Session Safety Assessment**
   - Complete the [Daily Safety Checklist]({{ site.baseurl }}/for-coaches/safety-leadership/daily-safety-checklist) before each session
   - Conduct equipment safety checks for all boats and safety gear
   - Assess weather conditions and make go/no-go decisions
   - Brief assistant coaches on safety roles and responsibilities

2. **Participant Safety Management**
   - Ensure all participants have completed required safety training
   - Verify that all participants can demonstrate basic self-rescue skills
   - Monitor all participants' physical condition during sessions
   - Enforce proper use of safety equipment and procedures

3. **Environment Monitoring**
   - Continuously assess weather and water conditions during sessions
   - Monitor boat traffic and potential hazards on the water
   - Track participant locations and maintain appropriate supervision ratios
   - Maintain awareness of all participants' positions at all times

4. **Emergency Readiness**
   - Be prepared to execute [emergency procedures]({{ site.baseurl }}/for-coaches/safety-leadership/emergency-procedures) when needed
   - Ensure all emergency equipment is readily accessible
   - Maintain CPR and First Aid certification
   - Know emergency contact procedures and communication protocols

## Required Safety Equipment

### Coach Launch Equipment
Each coach launch must be equipped with:

- Coast Guard-approved PFD for each person in the launch
- Additional PFDs for emergency use
- Paddle or oar
- Bailer or pump
- Whistle or air horn
- First aid kit
- Thermal blankets
- Throw bag with minimum 50ft floating line
- Cell phone in waterproof case
- Engine kill switch attached to operator

### Coach Personal Equipment
Each coach should have:

- PFD worn at all times in the launch
- Whistle attached to PFD
- Appropriate clothing for weather conditions
- Sun protection (when applicable)
- Hydration

## Safety Briefings

### Pre-Program Safety Briefing
Before the first session of each Learn to Scull program, conduct a comprehensive safety briefing covering:

- Flip test requirements and procedures
- Emergency protocols and communication signals
- Boathouse safety rules and procedures
- River navigation patterns and rules
- Equipment handling safety

### Daily Safety Reminders
At the beginning of each session, provide a brief safety reminder addressing:

- Current weather and water conditions
- Specific hazards or considerations for the day
- Today's designated rowing area boundaries
- Emergency signals review
- Communication protocols

## Launch Operations Safety

When operating the coaching launch:

- Maintain a safe distance from sculling shells
- Approach capsized boats from downwind when possible
- Cut engine when in close proximity to swimmers or capsized boats
- Maintain slow speeds near docks, narrow waterways, and congested areas
- Always attach engine kill switch lanyard when operating
- Never exceed passenger capacity of the launch

## Risk Assessment

Conduct a risk assessment before each session, including:

1. **Environmental Risks**
   - Weather conditions (wind, temperature, lightning potential)
   - Water conditions (current, debris, temperature)
   - Visibility (fog, rain, early morning light)
   - Other water traffic

2. **Participant Risks**
   - Skill levels and experience
   - Physical condition and fatigue
   - Medical considerations
   - Previous challenges or concerns

3. **Equipment Risks**
   - Boat condition and appropriateness
   - Safety equipment readiness
   - Launch functionality
   - Communication equipment reliability

## Decision-Making Framework

Use this framework when making safety-related decisions:

1. **Low Risk**: Proceed with normal activities
   - Good weather, appropriate water conditions
   - Fully equipped and prepared
   - Participants demonstrating appropriate skills

2. **Moderate Risk**: Modify activities with additional precautions
   - Challenging but manageable conditions
   - Stay closer to shore
   - Increase coaching supervision ratio
   - Limit technical complexity of drills

3. **High Risk**: Consider cancellation or significant modification
   - Unsafe weather or water conditions
   - Equipment issues compromising safety
   - Participant conditions raising concerns
   - Unable to maintain adequate supervision

4. **Unacceptable Risk**: Cancel on-water activities
   - Thunderstorms or lightning in vicinity
   - Wind or current beyond safe limits
   - Water temperature + air temperature < 100Â°F combined
   - Safety equipment unavailable or inadequate

## Incident Reporting

All safety incidents, even minor ones, must be reported and documented:

1. Address immediate safety needs
2. Document incident details as soon as practical
3. Report to program coordinator and safety officer
4. Complete formal incident report within 24 hours
5. Participate in incident review process if requested
6. Implement recommended safety improvements

## Safety Certification Requirements

All Learn to Scull coaches must maintain:
- Current First Aid certification
- Current CPR/AED certification
- US Rowing Level 1 Coach Certification (or equivalent)
- Boating safety certification as required by state law
