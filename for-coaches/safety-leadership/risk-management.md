# Risk Management for Learn to Scull Coaches

Effective risk management is essential to providing a safe and positive learning environment in the Learn to Scull program. This guide outlines the process for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks in our program.

## Risk Management Framework

### 1. Risk Identification

The first step in managing risk is to identify potential hazards across all aspects of the program:

#### Environmental Risks
- Weather conditions (wind, rain, lightning, temperature)
- Water conditions (current, depth, temperature, obstacles)
- Traffic patterns (other water users, bridges, narrow channels)
- Wildlife encounters (geese, swans, fish)
- Shore conditions (dock access, entry/exit points)

#### Participant-Related Risks
- Skill level and experience
- Physical fitness and health conditions
- Swimming ability
- Psychological factors (fear, overconfidence)
- Age and developmental considerations

#### Equipment Risks
- Boat condition and maintenance
- Launch functionality and readiness
- Safety equipment availability and condition
- Boathouse and facility hazards

#### Programmatic Risks
- Coaching qualifications and ratios
- Communication systems
- Emergency response capabilities
- Transportation logistics
- Scheduling considerations (early morning, evening sessions)

### 2. Risk Assessment

Once identified, assess each risk based on:

| Risk Level | Likelihood | Severity | Action Required |
|------------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Low** | Unlikely to occur | Minor impact, easily addressed | Monitor and apply standard procedures |
| **Medium** | May occur | Moderate impact, requires attention | Implement specific controls and precautions |
| **High** | Likely to occur | Significant impact, potential injuries | Detailed mitigation plan required or activity modification |
| **Extreme** | Highly likely | Severe impact, serious injury potential | Activity should not proceed until risk is reduced |

Use the risk matrix below to categorize risks:

### 3. Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Environmental Risk Controls
- **Weather Monitoring**: Check forecasts before each session and establish thresholds for cancellation
- **Water Assessment**: Regular checks of water conditions and known hazards
- **Traffic Management**: Clearly communicate and enforce traffic patterns
- **Protected Areas**: Identify and use protected water areas for novice instruction

#### Participant Risk Controls
- **Screening**: Health questionnaires and swimming ability verification
- **Skill Progression**: Structured skill development with appropriate challenges
- **Supervision Ratios**: Maintain 1:3 coach-to-participant ratio on water
- **Buddy System**: Pair participants for mutual support and monitoring

#### Equipment Risk Controls
- **Regular Maintenance**: Scheduled checks of all boats and equipment
- **Pre-Session Inspection**: Daily checks of boats, launches, and safety gear
- **Equipment Selection**: Match boat types to participant abilities and conditions
- **Safety Equipment**: Ensure proper PFDs, first aid kits, communication devices

#### Program Risk Controls
- **Coach Certification**: Ensure all coaches have proper qualifications
- **Clear Protocols**: Written procedures for standard operations and emergencies
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of incidents, near-misses, and responses
- **Communication Plans**: Establish reliable communication systems for all conditions

### 4. Implementation and Monitoring

#### Pre-Program Planning
- Conduct seasonal risk assessment
- Review and update risk management protocols
- Train coaches on risk management procedures
- Prepare and stock emergency equipment

#### Daily Implementation
- Use the [Daily Safety Checklist]({{ site.baseurl }}/for-coaches/safety-leadership/daily-safety-checklist)
- Conduct pre-session risk assessment
- Brief participants on specific daily risks
- Assign specific risk monitoring duties to coaching team

#### Continuous Monitoring
- Maintain ongoing awareness of changing conditions
- Evaluate effectiveness of risk controls
- Document incidents and near-misses
- Make real-time adjustments as needed

### 5. Review and Improvement

#### Post-Incident Review
- Thoroughly document any incidents
- Analyze root causes and contributing factors
- Review effectiveness of response
- Implement improvements to prevent recurrence

#### Program Review
- End-of-season risk management audit
- Participant and coach feedback analysis
- Review of all incident reports and near-misses
- Update risk management plan for subsequent programs

## Specific Risk Management Tools

### Decision-Making Frameworks

#### Weather Decision Matrix

| Condition | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk | Extreme Risk |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Wind** | <8 mph | 8-12 mph | 12-15 mph | >15 mph |
| **Temperature (air)** | >60°F | 50-60°F | 40-50°F | <40°F |
| **Temperature (water)** | >60°F | 50-60°F | 40-50°F | <40°F |
| **Visibility** | >500m | 200-500m | 100-200m | <100m |
| **Lightning** | None in forecast | Possible in area | Present >10 miles | Present <10 miles |
| **Precipitation** | None-Light | Moderate | Heavy | Severe/Thunderstorm |

#### Combined Risk Assessment

1. Identify the risk level for each factor
2. If any factor is "Extreme Risk," cancel on-water activities
3. If two or more factors are "High Risk," consider cancellation or significant modification
4. If majority of factors are "Medium Risk," implement specific modifications and precautions

### Risk Management Checklists

#### Pre-Season Risk Management Checklist
- Review and update emergency action plans
- Verify coach certifications and qualifications
- Inspect all equipment and facilities
- Update participant screening procedures
- Review insurance coverage and requirements
- Update emergency contact information

#### Daily Risk Management Protocol
1. Weather and water condition assessment
2. Equipment safety checks
3. Participant readiness evaluation
4. Emergency equipment verification
5. Communication systems check
6. Hazard communication briefing

## Risk Management Responsibilities
