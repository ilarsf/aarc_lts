# Safety Leadership

As a coach, you are the primary safety leader for your participants. This section provides resources for maintaining a safe learning environment and handling emergency situations effectively.

## Safety Resources

- [Safety Protocols](safety-protocols.md) - Coach-specific safety responsibilities
- [Daily Safety Checklist](daily-safety-checklist.md) - Pre-session safety verification
- [Emergency Procedures](emergency-procedures.md) - Response protocols for various scenarios
- [Risk Management](risk-management.md) - Identifying and mitigating potential hazards

Safety leadership requires vigilance, preparation, and decisive action when needed. These resources will help you develop and implement safety practices that protect participants while allowing them to build confidence in their rowing abilities.
