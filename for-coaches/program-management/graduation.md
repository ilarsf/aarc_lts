# Learn to Scull Program Graduation Requirements

This document outlines the standards and protocols for program completion and certification in the AARC Learn to Scull program. Successful graduation signifies that a participant has demonstrated the necessary skills, knowledge, and safety awareness to progress to the next stage of their rowing journey, as assessed by the coaching team.

## Core Competencies for Graduation

To graduate from the Learn to Scull program, participants must demonstrate satisfactory proficiency, as evaluated by the coaching staff during the program and particularly in Session 4. The assessment focuses on five key areas, aligned with the club's overall rower development pathway:

1.  **Safety Awareness & Practices:**
    *   Successful completion of the mandatory flip test (capsize and recovery).
    *   Consistent application of water safety rules, including understanding river traffic patterns (e.g., staying to the correct side, yielding right-of-way) and proper lookout procedures.
    *   Knowledge of how to respond to common on-water situations (e.g., equipment issues, changing weather).
    *   Ability to assess weather conditions and make safe decisions regarding rowing.
    *   Understanding of emergency procedures.

2.  **Boat Handling & Equipment Management:**
    *   Ability to safely carry, launch, and dock a single scull with appropriate technique, demonstrating increasing independence.
    *   Proper and safe entry into and exit from the boat.
    *   Familiarity with essential boat components and oar handling (e.g., feathering, squaring).
    *   Demonstrated respect and care for equipment, including proper cleaning and storage.
    *   Ability to perform basic equipment checks and identify potential issues.

3.  **Technical Sculling Proficiency:**
    *   Consistent execution of the fundamental sculling stroke sequence (catch, drive, finish, recovery).
    *   Ability to maintain balance and set the boat in calm to light chop conditions.
    *   Control during all phases of the stroke, including smooth power application and controlled recovery.
    *   Effective blade work (e.g., appropriate depth, clean catches and releases).
    *   Ability to row continuously with reasonable form for a period appropriate to program goals (e.g., 10-15 minutes).

4.  **Steering & Navigation:**
    *   Ability to steer a consistent course and make controlled turns.
    *   Maintain awareness of surroundings and navigate safely with respect to other water users and fixed obstacles.
    *   Understanding and application of local navigation rules, including bridge passage protocols if applicable.
    *   Ability to look over the shoulder effectively while maintaining course and rhythm.

5.  **Independence & Decision-Making:**
    *   Ability to understand and effectively apply coach instructions and feedback.
    *   Demonstrates developing self-assessment skills regarding their own technique and environmental conditions.
    *   Follows club procedures for equipment use (e.g., sign-out/in, reporting damage).
    *   Shows good judgment and asks for help when needed.

## Assessment Process

*   **Ongoing Formative Assessment:** Coaches provide continuous feedback and informal assessment throughout all four sessions.
*   **Mid-Program Check-in:** An informal review of progress typically occurs after Session 2 to identify areas requiring more focus.
*   **Final Skills Evaluation (Session 4):** While assessment is ongoing, Session 4 serves as the primary opportunity for a comprehensive evaluation of the participant's skills against the core competencies. This includes observation during drills, continuous rowing, and specific tasks designed to demonstrate proficiency.
*   **Coach Consensus:** Graduation is determined by a consensus of the coaching team, led by the program coordinator and primary session coaches. This decision is based on the overall observed skill level, safety competence, and readiness to progress.

## Competency Levels & Graduation Outcome

While the program aims for all participants to achieve a "Proficient" (Level 3) standard for independent sculling, graduation from Learn to Scull primarily signifies that a rower has achieved at least a "Competent" (Level 2) standard. This means they:
*   Demonstrate consistent safety practices.
*   Can handle a boat independently in calm conditions.
*   Show solid fundamental technique.
*   Can navigate familiar areas with minimal supervision.

Participants will be informed of their assessed competency level (e.g., Developing, Competent, Proficient) as per the club's assessment guidelines.

## Certification & Next Steps

Upon successful completion of the Learn to Scull program and achieving at least a "Competent" (Level 2) standard across the core competencies, participants are certified by AARC as having met the foundational skills for sculling. This certification opens several pathways for continued development:

*   **AARC Open Sculling Program Trial:** Graduates are encouraged to take advantage of a **four-week discounted trial period** in the Open Sculling Program. This program provides a supportive, supervised environment to further hone skills, build confidence, and experience rowing in a group setting. This is an excellent bridge to more independent rowing.
*   **Full Club Membership:** Joining AARC as a full member provides access to club boats, facilities, and a vibrant rowing community.
*   **Novice and Intermediate Programs:** Depending on skill progression and interest, graduates can join structured novice or intermediate programs that offer continued coaching and development.
*   **Technique Clinics & Workshops:** AARC periodically offers specialized clinics focusing on specific aspects of sculling technique, boat handling, or safety.
*   **Private Coaching:** For those seeking personalized attention and accelerated development, private coaching sessions with AARC-certified coaches are available.
*   **Recreational Rowing:** Enjoying the beauty of the river and the physical benefits of sculling in a relaxed, non-competitive environment.

The coaching team will discuss these options with each participant during the final session, providing guidance based on individual progress and goals.

## Considerations for Participants Requiring Further Development

If a participant does not meet the "Competent" level for graduation by the end of the program, coaches will:

*   Provide clear, constructive, and supportive feedback detailing the specific skills or knowledge areas needing improvement.
*   Discuss potential pathways for further skill development. This is not a failure, but an indication that more time and practice are needed. Options may include:
    *   Targeted extension lessons (individual or small group).
    *   Repeating specific sessions or the entire Learn to Scull program (often at a reduced rate, if available).
    *   Joining specific supervised practice sessions designed for skill consolidation.
    *   Partnered rowing with experienced mentors.

The primary goal of the AARC Learn to Scull program is to ensure all participants develop into safe, confident, and skilled scullers who can enjoy the sport, regardless of their initial learning pace. Graduation is a milestone, and the club is committed to supporting each rower's ongoing journey.
