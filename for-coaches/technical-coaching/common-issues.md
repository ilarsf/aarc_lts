# Common Technical Issues and Corrections

This reference guide provides detailed analysis of the most common technical issues encountered by novice scullers, along with effective correction strategies. For each issue, we've included the probable causes, appropriate drills, effective coaching cues, and progression indicators.

<div class="info-box tip">
  <h4>Using This Guide</h4>
  <p>Focus on one correction at a time rather than overwhelming novice rowers with multiple technique points. Connect your coaching to the frameworks of KRAFT and Black Bear Sequence for consistency.</p>
