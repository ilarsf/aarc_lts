# About Ann Arbor Rowing Club

The Ann Arbor Rowing Club (AARC) is a volunteer‑run 501(c)(3) that promotes rowing on the Huron River for adults of all backgrounds and abilities.

## Mission

We work to make rowing safe, welcoming, and affordable by

- teaching beginners through our Learn to Row and Learn to Scull classes  
- providing coached training and racing for experienced athletes  
- offering adaptive rowing and financial assistance so cost or disability is never a barrier  
- fostering community, fitness, and respect for the river  

## Programs

- **Learn to Row / Learn to Scull:** step‑by‑step introduction for first‑time rowers  
- **Technical Sweep:** small‑group sessions that refine technique  
- **Open Sweep and Sculling:** coached recreational or competitive training  
- **Adaptive Rowing:** customized sessions for athletes with disabilities  
- **Winter Training:** erg, strength, and conditioning during the off‑water season  
- **Private Coaching:** one‑on‑one instruction  

## Facilities

Our boathouse and dock on the Huron River give members several miles of sheltered water. The fleet includes eights, fours, pairs, quads, doubles, singles, and adaptive shells. We are currently fundraising for an accessible dock upgrade.

## Membership

- Open to adults (18+) who can swim 100 m  
- Club boats, oars, ergs, and safety launches included  
- Discounts for students and veterans; scholarships available  
- Volunteer hours keep fees low — members help at events, maintain equipment, and steward the river  

## Community Engagement

- **Adaptive and Scholarship Programs:** removing financial or physical barriers  
- **Veteran Outreach:** dedicated seats and events for service members  
- **River Stewardship:** clean‑ups and education with local partners  
- **Community Rows:** public open‑house rows each summer
