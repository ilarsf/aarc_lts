# Boathouse Rules and Equipment Care

Proper care and handling of equipment not only extends its lifespan but also ensures it remains in good working condition for everyone. This guide covers important boathouse etiquette and equipment maintenance responsibilities.

## General Boathouse Rules

- **Sign Out/In**: Always record your boat usage in the logbook before launching and sign back in upon return, including any issues encountered during your row.

- **Boat Assignment**: Use only the boat and oars that you have been assigned or are appropriate for your skill level.

- **Footwear**: Wear appropriate footwear in the boathouse. Street shoes are allowed on the dock but not in the boats.

- **Quiet Hours**: Respect neighbors by minimizing noise during early morning hours (before 7 AM) and evening hours (after 9 PM).

- **Security**: The last person leaving the boathouse is responsible for ensuring all doors and gates are locked.

- **Keep Pathways Clear**: Never leave equipment blocking walkways, doorways, or launch areas.

- **Storage Areas**: Return all equipment to its designated storage location after use.

- **Food and Drink**: No food allowed in boat bay areas. Water bottles only on the dock.

## Equipment Handling and Storage

### Boat Handling

- **Carrying Boats**: Always lift with proper technique and adequate help. Ask for assistance if needed.

- **Proper Carrying Positions**: Follow correct hand positions and carrying techniques specific to each boat type.

- **Using Slings/Stretchers**: Place boats carefully on stretchers when adjusting foot stretchers or performing maintenance.

- **Step Ladders**: Use the provided step ladders for reaching high racks; never climb on the racks themselves.

- **Launching and Docking**: Move carefully on docks, keeping boats parallel to the dock when launching and docking.

- **Oar Transport**: Carry oars blade forward, with the blade in front of you and up.

### Boat and Equipment Care

#### Pre-Row Checks

1. **Inspect Before Rowing**:
   - Check heel restraints (must be able to release heels with minimal upward pressure)
   - Verify bow ball is secure
   - Ensure all hatches are properly sealed
   - Check oarlocks and pins for tightness
   - Examine the hull for any damage
   - Test foot stretcher adjustments

2. **Adjustments**:
   - Make foot stretcher adjustments on slings, not in the water
   - Only make adjustments you're trained to perform
   - Return all tools to their proper locations

#### Post-Row Procedures

1. **Cleaning the Boat**:
   - Place boat on stretchers/slings after use
   - Thoroughly wipe down the entire boat, including tracks, seats, and riggers
   - Pay special attention to removing river water/scum before it dries
   - Clean out foot wells and cockpit areas

2. **Storing the Boat**:
   - Return boat to its proper rack position
   - Place boats on racks in the same orientation as found
   - Secure outdoor boats with straps appropriate to boat type
   - Ensure riggers are properly aligned with other boats

3. **Oar Care**:
   - Wipe down handles with provided desinfecting wipes
   - Store oars in designated racks with blades facing the correct direction
   - Report any issues with grips, collars, or blade surfaces

## Reporting Damage and Maintenance

- **Immediate Reporting**: Report any damage or equipment issues immediately in the logbook and to the boathouse manager.

- **Damage Tags**: Use red tags to mark damaged equipment. Include your name, date, and description of the issue.

- **When in Doubt**: If unsure about equipment condition, err on the side of caution - report it and do not use it.

- **Follow-up**: Check the repair status before using previously damaged equipment.
