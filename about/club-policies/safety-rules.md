## Compliance and Enforcement

All members are expected to follow these safety rules and help enforce them. Violations should be reported to the Safety Committee. Repeated violations may result in revocation of rowing privileges.

Safety Committee members and coaches have the authority to prohibit any individual from rowing if, in their judgment, conditions are unsafe or the individual is not prepared for the existing conditions.
