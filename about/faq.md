      <h3>What is sculling?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Sculling is a form of rowing where each rower uses two oars (one in each hand), as opposed to sweep rowing where each rower uses a single oar. Sculling boats include singles (one person), doubles (two people), and quads (four people). The Learn to Scull program focuses primarily on single sculling, which gives each participant independent control of their boat.</p>

            <li><strong>Full Club Membership:</strong> Required for participation in any AARC programs</li>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Will I be good enough to row independently after just four sessions?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>The Learn to Scull program provides a foundation in sculling basics. By the end, most participants can:

            <li>Execute basic sculling technique</li>

        However, becoming truly proficient at sculling requires continued practice. The Open Sculling Program provides a supported environment where you can continue developing your skills under supervision before moving to fully independent rowing.
