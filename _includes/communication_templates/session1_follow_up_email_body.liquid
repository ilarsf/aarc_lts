Dear {{ page.lts_program_number }} Participants,<br><br>

Great job at our first Learn to Scull session!<br><br>

**Key Achievements From Session 1**<br>
*   Reiterated the basic rowing motion using ergometers.<br>
*   Got familiar with equipment terminology and boat handling.<br>
*   Attempted the essential "flip test" to practice water safety.<br>
*   Built comfort and confidence around rowing equipment and water.<br><br>

**Preparing for Session 2: Hitting the Water**<br>
To build on what you've learned, you can prepare for our first on-water session by reviewing the following:<br>
1.  **Video Resources for Session 2:** Watch the [Session 2 Videos](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/for-learners/technique/videos.html?filter=session2) to see these concepts in action.<br>
2.  Review the [Session 2 Learning Guide](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/for-learners/learning-journey/session-2.html) for an overview of what we'll cover.<br><br>

**Next Session: {{ page.session_dates[1] | default: "[Day, Date, Time]" }}**<br>
We'll focus on:<br>
*   Equipment Preparation and Transport<br>

*   Mastering safe launching and landing procedures.<br><br>

**Reminders**<br>
