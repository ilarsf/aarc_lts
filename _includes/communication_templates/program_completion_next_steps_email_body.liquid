Dear [Participant Name],<br><br>

Congratulations on successfully completing AARC's Learn to Scull program! It has been a pleasure watching your progression from your first strokes on the ergometer to confidently navigating the Huron River.<br><br>

**Your Achievements**<br><br>

During these four sessions, you've demonstrated competency in:
- Boat handling and equipment knowledge
- Basic sculling technique and stroke sequencing
- Water safety and self-rescue procedures
- River traffic patterns and navigation
<br><br>

**Next Steps with AARC**<br><br>

We encourage you to continue your rowing journey with us! The most common and recommended next step is the <strong>Open Sculling Program Trial</strong>. <br><br>

1.  **Open Sculling Program Trial:**
    *   Highly recommended for all graduates! This multi-week discounted trial period allows you to row in a supervised group setting, further honing your skills and building confidence on the water.
    *   It's an excellent bridge from structured lessons to more independent rowing, providing regular water time, opportunities to row with other recent graduates and experienced members, continued informal coaching, and a chance to become comfortable with club routines and equipment.
    *   This trial phase requires payment of a program fee. Your LTS coaches will provide details on how to sign up for this trial during your final session.
    *   For more details, please see the [Open Sculling Program Trial & Continuation guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/for-learners/resources/open-sculling-program-details.html).
