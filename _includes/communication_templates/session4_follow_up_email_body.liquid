Hi {{ page.lts_program_number }} Crew,<br><br>

Congratulations on completing Session 4 and the Learn to Scull program! It was great to see you integrate all the skills and row with more independence today.<br><br>

**Key Achievements from Session 4**<br>
*   Integrated all previously learned skills.<br>
*   Developed confidence in river navigation, including bridge passage.<br>
*   Demonstrated independent sculling capability.<br><br>

**Reflecting on Your Journey**<br>
Think about how far you've come in just four sessions! From learning the basic stroke on the erg to sculling independently on the river, you've built a strong foundation.<br><br>

**Continue Your Rowing Journey**<br>
Learn more about continuing with sculling: [Open Sculling Program Details]({{ site.baseurl }}/for-learners/resources/open-sculling-program-details.html).<br>
The one-month “trial” registration for Learn to Scull is now open.<br>
*   If you wish to take advantage of the trial and are not already covered by the annual or summer program fee, please [register online](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/). <br> <!-- Consider making this a configurable link e.g., {{ site.data.links.lts_registration | default: "YOUR_REGISTRATION_LINK" }} -->
*   The trial covers sculling only (no sweep) and can start as early as Monday.<br><br>

We will be sending you a separate email shortly with information on next steps to continue your rowing journey with AARC.<br><br>

Thank you for being a fantastic participant! We hope to see you on the water again very soon.<br><br>

Best regards,<br><br>
