Dear LTS Participants,<br><br>

Congratulations on completing Session 4 and the Learn to Scull program! It was great to see you integrate all the skills and row with more independence today.<br><br>

**KEY ACHIEVEMENTS FROM SESSION 4**<br><br>
*   Integrated all previously learned skills.<br>
*   Developed confidence in river navigation, including bridge passage.<br>
*   Demonstrated independent sculling capability.<br><br>

**REFLECTING ON YOUR JOURNEY**<br><br>
Think about how far you've come in just four sessions! From learning the basic stroke on the erg to sculling independently on the river, you've built a strong foundation.<br><br>

We will be sending you a separate email shortly with information on next steps to continue your rowing journey with AARC.<br><br>

Thank you for being a fantastic participant! We hope to see you on the water again very soon.<br><br>

Best regards,<br><br>
