Hi {{ page.lts_program_number }} Crew,<br><br>

Fantastic job in Session 3! You're now applying power more effectively and getting comfortable with navigating the boat.<br><br>

**Key Achievements from Session 3**<br>
*   Developed effective leg drive and power application.<br>
*   Learned navigation principles and river traffic patterns.<br>
*   Mastered boat control through turns and varying stroke pressure.<br>
*   Building confidence through continuous rowing.<br><br>

**Preparing for Session 4: Navigation and Working Up River**<br>
For our final session, where we integrate all skills and focus on independent sculling, please review:<br><br>
1.  **Video Resources for Session 4:** Watch the [Session 4 Videos](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/for-learners/technique/videos.html?filter=session4).<br>
2.  Review the [Session 4 Learning Guide](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/for-learners/learning-journey/session-4.html).<br><br>

**Next Session: {{ page.session_dates[3] | default: "[Day, Date, Time]" }}**<br>
Our final session will focus on:<br>
*   Integrating all previously learned skills.<br>
*   Developing confidence in river navigation, including bridges.<br>
*   Achieving independent sculling capability.<br>

**Continue Your Rowing Journey**<br>
Learn more about continuing with sculling: [Open Sculling Program Details]({{ site.baseurl }}/for-learners/resources/open-sculling-program-details.html).<br>
The one-month “trial” registration for Learn to Scull is now open.<br>
*   If you wish to take advantage of the trial and are not already covered by the annual or summer program fee, please [register online](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/). <br> <!-- Consider making this a configurable link e.g., {{ site.data.links.lts_registration | default: "YOUR_REGISTRATION_LINK" }} -->
*   The trial covers sculling only (no sweep) and can start as early as Monday.<br><br>

**If you missed the Thursday noon sign-up and still want to try to row next week:**<br>
1.  Pay the program fee (if not already done, covered) and follow [the website instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/for-learners/resources/open-sculling-program-details.html).<br>
2.  Please email your instructors so we can ask Tom Kraft, our Sculling Head Coach, to consider your late request — there is no guarantee of getting boated.<br><br>
