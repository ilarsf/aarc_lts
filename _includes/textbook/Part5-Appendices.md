## Appendix A: Glossary of Rowing Terms

Understanding the language of rowing will help you communicate effectively with coaches and fellow rowers. This glossary covers common terms related to equipment, technique, and commands. *(Sourced primarily from program materials).*

### Boat Parts and Equipment

* **Bow:** The forward end of the boat (crosses finish line first).
* **Bow Ball:** Safety ball attached to the bow of the boat.

* **Pitch:** The angle of the oarlock relative to the boat.
* **Port:** Left side of the boat when facing the bow (rower's right side when seated).
* **Rigger:** Metal or carbon framework extending from the gunwale to hold the oarlock.
* **Seat:** The sliding seat the rower sits on.
* **Shell:** Another term for a rowing boat.

* **Washboard:** The decking area at bow and stern.

### Oar Components

* **Blade (or Spoon):** The flat, wide part of the oar that enters the water.

### Rowing Technique Terms

* **Body Angle:** The forward lean from the hips at the catch.
* **Catch:** The moment when the blade enters the water at the beginning of the drive phase.
* **Crab:** Losing control of an oar, causing the blade to get stuck in the water and the handle to potentially hit the rower.
* **Digging:** When the blade goes too deep in the water during the drive.
* **Drive:** The power phase of the stroke when the blade is in the water, propelling the boat.
* **Feathering:** Rotating the blade to be parallel to the water surface during the recovery.
* **Finish (or Release):** The end of the drive phase when the blade is removed cleanly from the water.
* **Layback:** The backward lean of the body (from the hips) at the finish position.
* **Power 10:** A call for 10 strokes at increased power or focus.
* **Rating (or Stroke Rate):** The number of strokes taken per minute (spm).
* **Recovery:** The phase of the stroke when the rower moves from the finish back towards the stern to prepare for the next catch; blades are out of the water.
* **Run:** The distance the boat glides between strokes.
* **Rushing:** Moving too quickly on the recovery/slide, often disrupting boat balance and run.
* **Set (or Balance):** Keeping the boat level side-to-side.
* **Skying:** Raising the blade too high above the water just before the catch.
* **Squaring:** Rotating the blade to be perpendicular to the water surface just before the catch.
* **Washing Out:** When the blade comes out of the water too early during the drive, losing power.

### Commands and Navigation

* **Back (or Back it Down):** Command to row in reverse by pushing the handles away.
* **Buoy:** A floating marker often used to indicate traffic patterns or race courses.
* **Check it down:** See "Hold Water".

* **Full Pressure:** Command for maximum rowing effort.
* **Hands On:** Command to take hold of the boat (usually on the gunwales) in preparation for lifting or moving.
* **Hold Water:** Command to stop the boat quickly by squaring the blades vertically in the water.
* **Let It Run:** Command to stop rowing and allow the boat to glide.
* **Light on the Feet:** Command for easy pressure rowing.
* **Ready All, Row:** The standard command sequence to begin rowing together.
* **Regatta:** A rowing race event.
* **Traffic Pattern:** The established "rules of the road" for navigating the waterway (e.g., stay starboard/right).
* **Way Enough (or Weigh Enough):** The command to stop rowing.
