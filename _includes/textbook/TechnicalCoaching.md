## Technical Coaching Framework

### Teaching Progressions

Effective technical coaching follows a structured progression that builds skills incrementally:

1. **Foundation Skills**
   - Body positioning and posture
   - Basic grip and hand position
   - Understanding the parts of the stroke

2. **Skill Development**
   - Proper sequencing of the rowing stroke
   - Blade work fundamentals
   - Developing rhythm and timing

3. **Refinement**
   - Power application
   - Advanced blade control
   - Speed and efficiency

#### Recommended Teaching Sequence

Begin each new skill with this approach:

1. **Explain** - Use clear, concise language with consistent terminology
2. **Demonstrate** - Show the movement with proper technique
3. **Practice** - Allow participants to attempt the skill with guidance
4. **Feedback** - Provide specific, actionable feedback
5. **Refine** - Guide adjustments based on observed performance

### Common Technical Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Coaching Solutions |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **Rushing the slide** | - Fast recovery<br>- Poor boat run<br>- Lack of rhythm | - Count recovery timing<br>- Practice pausing drills<br>- Focus on "slow-quick" ratio |
| **Poor blade depth** | - Washing out<br>- Digging deep<br>- Uneven blade depth | - Hand height awareness<br>- Square blade drills<br>- Reference point visualization |
| **Sequential flaws** | - Arms break early<br>- Back opens too soon<br>- Poor body positioning | - Segmented stroke drills<br>- Pause drills<br>- Exaggerated sequence practice |
| **Balance issues** | - Tipping side to side<br>- Uneven pressure<br>- Tension in upper body | - Hand pressure exercises<br>- Core engagement drills<br>- Feathering technique practice |

### Drill Sequencing

Effective drill progression moves from simple to complex, following this pathway:

#### Beginner Phase
1. **Static drills** - Core position holds, grip practice
2. **Partial strokes** - Arms only, body swing, quarter slide
3. **Blade control** - Square blade rowing, feathering practice

#### Intermediate Phase
4. **Technical drills** - Pause drills, sequencing practice
5. **Power development** - Legs-only driving, coordinated power application
6. **Balance drills** - One hand rowing, eyes-closed rowing (supervised)

#### Advanced Phase
7. **Rhythm development** - Varied rate and pressure drills
8. **Refinement drills** - Pick drill, suspension drills
9. **Speed work** - Build drills, racing starts practice

### Effective Coaching Cues

Verbal cues should be:
- **Brief** - 2-3 words maximum
- **Specific** - Target exactly what needs changing
- **Positive** - Focus on desired action, not the error
- **Consistent** - Use the same terminology throughout

#### Key Coaching Phrases
- "Push, don't pull"
- "Hands before body"
- "Body before slide"
- "Lengthen, don't lunge"
- "Light hands, heavy feet"

### Video Analysis Framework

When using video for technique feedback:
1. Begin with **positive observations**
2. Focus on **maximum 2-3 key points**
3. Use **side-by-side comparison** with model technique
4. Provide **specific actionable corrections**
5. End with **positive reinforcement**

### Adaptive Teaching Approaches

Adjust your coaching style to match participant learning preferences:
- **Visual learners** - Use demonstrations, diagrams, video
- **Auditory learners** - Explain clearly, use rhythm cues, analogies
- **Kinesthetic learners** - Guided movement, feel-based cues, hands-on adjustments

Remember that effective technical coaching balances precision with enjoyment. Maintain a positive atmosphere even while pursuing technical excellence.
