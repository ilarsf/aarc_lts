## Common Technical Issues & Corrections

This reference guide helps coaches quickly identify and address common technical problems.

### Recovery Sequence

#### Issue: Rushing the Slide
- **Visual Cues:** Quick return to catch, lack of control, boat surge/check
- **Correction Approaches:**
  - Verbal: "Slow hands away," "Feel the glide," "Extend the recovery"
  - Technical: Hands away first, then body over, then slide
  - Drills: Pause drilling, 1/4 slide rowing, counting during recovery

#### Issue: Early Slide Initiation
- **Visual Cues:** Knees bend before hands clear them, hunched position
- **Correction Approaches:**
  - Verbal: "Hands away FIRST," "Clear the knees," "Body pivot before slide"
  - Technical: Emphasize sequential hand movement followed by body pivot
  - Drills: Pause at hands-away position, pause at body-over position

### Drive Phase

#### Issue: Early Back Swing
- **Visual Cues:** Opening back before legs engaged, missing leg drive
- **Correction Approaches:**
  - Verbal: "Legs first," "Press through heels," "Late back swing"
  - Technical: Connect foot pressure to handle movement
  - Drills: Legs-only rowing, partial slide focus

#### Issue: Pulling with Arms Too Early
- **Visual Cues:** Bent elbows at catch, losing connection
- **Correction Approaches:**
  - Verbal: "Hang from straight arms," "Connection before pull"
  - Technical: Maintain arm extension during initial drive
  - Drills: Pause during drive, focus on arm timing

### Blade Work

#### Issue: Skying
- **Visual Cues:** Blades too high above water on recovery/catch
- **Correction Approaches:**
  - Verbal: "Flat hands," "Consistent blade height"
  - Technical: Level wrists, proper grip orientation
  - Drills: Pause at catch, focus on blade height

#### Issue: Washing Out
- **Visual Cues:** Water disturbance, inconsistent blade depth
- **Correction Approaches:**
  - Verbal: "Lock the blades at full depth," "Feel the resistance"
  - Technical: Proper entry angle, consistent pressure
  - Drills: Square blade rowing, pause after catch

### Body Position

#### Issue: Hunched Posture
- **Visual Cues:** Rounded shoulders, curved spine
- **Correction Approaches:**
  - Verbal: "Sit tall," "Proud chest," "Hinge from hips not waist"
  - Technical: Engage core, maintain natural spinal curve
  - Drills: Pause at finish to check posture, seated press-ups

#### Issue: Overreaching at Catch
- **Visual Cues:** Shoulders hunched forward, balance issues
- **Correction Approaches:**
  - Verbal: "Relaxed reach," "Shoulders stay low"
  - Technical: Maintain shoulder position, focus on body angle
  - Drills: Partial slide rowing, pause at catch

## Equipment Adjustment Guide

This reference helps coaches assist participants with proper equipment setup.

### Foot Stretcher Adjustment

#### Proper Position Indicators
- **Oarlock Alignment:** Oarlocks should be slightly behind rower's torso at finish
- **Leg Extension:** Nearly full extension with about 10Â° knee bend at finish
- **Shin Angle:** Approximately vertical at catch position
- **Handle Clearance:** Handles should clear body by 1-2 inches at finish

#### Adjustment Process
1. Loosen stretcher wing nuts or clamps
2. Slide stretcher to appropriate position
3. Ensure stretcher is square to boat (perpendicular to keel line)
4. Securely tighten all fasteners
5. Verify position with rower in boat

### Oarlock Height

#### Height Indicators
- **Blade Depth:** Square blade should be covered to collar when horizontal
- **Handle Height:** Handles should be at comfortable height at finish
- **Clearance:** Blades should clear water on recovery without excessive height
- **Consistency:** Both oarlocks should be at same height

#### Adjustment Options
- **Spacers:** Adding/removing spacers under oarlock
- **Height Adjustable Gates:** Utilizing built-in adjustment mechanisms
- **Rigger Modifications:** Long-term adjustments to rigger height
- **Considerations:** Rower height, flexibility, and boat type

### Grip Size Modification

#### Appropriate Grip Size
- **Hand Size Match:** Grip circumference appropriate for rower's hand
- **Comfort Indicators:** No excessive gripping or hand fatigue
- **Control Factors:** Ability to manipulate oar handles effectively

#### Modification Methods
- **Grip Tape Application:** Adding layers for larger circumference
- **Heat-Shrink Tubing:** Professional grip enlargement
- **Custom Grips:** Specialized molded grips for specific needs
- **Temporary Solutions:** Athletic tape for immediate adaptation

### Foot Strap Adjustment

#### Proper Position
- **Ball of Foot:** Strap should cross at ball of foot (widest part)
- **Tightness:** Secure but not restricting circulation
- **Quick Release:** Ensure straps can be released quickly in emergency
- **Equal Position:** Both feet should have straps at same position

#### Safety Considerations
- **Emergency Release:** Demonstrate quick release technique
- **Testing:** Verify rower can remove feet quickly when needed
- **Visual Check:** Regular inspection of strap condition
- **Alternatives:** Different strap styles for specific needs

### Flip Test Instructions

```
The flip test (capsize recovery) is an essential safety skill for all scullers. During today's session, each participant will practice this important procedure in a controlled, supervised environment.

Process:
1. You'll enter a boat at the dock with coach assistance
2. Row to the designated flip test area in shallow, calm water
3. When ready, you'll intentionally flip the boat while coach is nearby
4. Practice self-recovery using the following technique:
   - Stay with the boat
   - Position yourself at center of hull
   - Reach across to far gunwale
   - Use strong leg kick while pulling across boat
   - Return boat to upright position
   - Re-enter from side using arms to pull torso up and across
5. Return to dock with coach assistance

Safety Measures:
- Coaches will be in water and in launch boat
- Activity occurs in protected, shallow area
- Life jackets available for anyone not confident in swimming ability
- Multiple practice attempts allowed if needed

This experience builds confidence and prepares you for the unlikely event of an actual capsize.
