# Part 4: For the Coach

## Chapter 8: Coaching Philosophy & Approach

Welcome to Part 4, dedicated to the coaches who make the AARC Learn to Scull program possible! This chapter outlines the core philosophy, key teaching frameworks, and effective strategies to help you create a supportive, safe, and effective learning environment for new scullers. *Refer to the full [Coach's Manual]({{ site.baseurl }}/course_materials/coach/Coach_Manual.html) for more detail.*

### Creating a Positive Learning Environment

Your primary goal is to teach rowing technique *and* foster a love for the sport in a welcoming atmosphere based on **Safety, Respect, and Kindness**.

* **Foster Curiosity:** Welcome questions, normalize the learning process.
* **Build Confidence:** Acknowledge effort, celebrate small successes, break down skills.
* **Promote Respect:** Encourage peer support, ensure respectful communication.
* **Be Patient & Calm:** Your attitude sets the tone for the group.
* **Share Enthusiasm:** Balance technical instruction with the joy of the sport.

### Key Technical Frameworks

Use these frameworks consistently for teaching and feedback:

#### KRAFTs' Keys

* **K:** **K**eep shoulders relaxed and down.
* **R:** **R**each from hips, not shoulders.
* **A:** **A**rms straight until legs are flat.
* **F:** **F**eather after extraction.
* **T:** **T**ap down before extraction.

![Placeholder: Simple icons or graphics representing each KRAFT key](placeholder)

#### Black Bear Sequence (BBS)

1.  **Grip and feather:** Hand position, blade control.
2.  **Release:** Clean exit, tap down.
3.  **Recovery/Catch:** Sequenced return (arms â†’ body â†’ slide).
4.  **Drive:** Connected power (legs â†’ back â†’ arms).
5.  **Steering:** Frequent looks, subtle corrections.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Refer learners to these frameworks. Use keywords consistently. *See the [Technical Frameworks Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/course_materials/coach/technical/Technical_Frameworks.html) for details.*

### Class Management Strategies (Coaching Approach)

* **Focus:** One major technical point per rower per session. Connect feedback to KRAFT/BBS.
* **Communicate Clearly:** Simple keywords, analogies ("Fingers like hooks").
* **Effective Feedback:** Specific, constructive, prompt. Use "feedback sandwich" (positive, correction, positive). Focus on desired action.
* **Adapt:** Tailor style (visual, auditory, kinesthetic). Adjust plan based on group/conditions.
* **Progress Logically:** Isolate skills before combining. Stable (erg) -> unstable (water). Slow -> normal speed.
* **Manage Fear:** Acknowledge anxieties (capsizing). Break down skills, provide initial support, reduce gradually.
* **Integrate Safety:** Weave safety into every activity (PFDs, handling, traffic, weather).

This chapter sets the stage. Following chapters detail session plans, drills, and operations.

## Chapter 9: Session Plans & Drills

This chapter provides detailed plans for each of the four Learn to Scull sessions. Adapt timings based on group progress/conditions, but cover core objectives. **Continuously integrate KRAFTs' Keys and the Black Bear Sequence (BBS) framework.** *Detailed plans are available online at [Session Plans]({{ site.baseurl }}/course_materials/coach/session_plans/).*

ðŸ’¡ **Coach's Tip:** Before each session, review the plan below and the **Daily Coach Checklist** (Chapter 10). Familiarize yourself with drills and common errors.

### Session 1: Learning the Motion and Getting Wet (3 hours)

### Participant Assessment

At the end of the program (Session 4), assess each participant's readiness using the **Rower Assessment Checklist**. *The full checklist is available online: [Participant Assessment Checklist]({{ site.baseurl }}/course_materials/coach/Participant_Assessment_Checklist.html).*

Review these points individually with rowers, providing constructive feedback.

#### Key Assessment Areas (Summary):

1.  **Equipment Handling:** Safe carry, racking, pre-launch sequence.
2.  **Launching/Landing:** Follows commands, safe entry/exit, controlled dock approach.
3.  **Basic Boat Control:** Stable rowing, basic sequence & leg drive, basic & pivot turns.
4.  **Navigation & Safety:** Looks around frequently, maintains starboard position, aware of surroundings, understands bridge rules.
5.  **Capsize Recovery:** Successful flip test completion OR calm swim-to-shore.
6.  **Post-Rowing:** Cleans/stores equipment, knows logbook reporting.

This checklist ensures consistent standards and provides clear feedback on readiness for next steps (e.g., Open Sculling).

### Communication Templates Integration

#### Using Templates:

1.  Refer to the **[Email Templates Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/course_materials/communication/Email_Templates.html)**.
2.  Available templates cover Pre-Course, During Course, and Post-Course communications.
