# Part 4: For the Coach

## Chapter 8: Coaching Philosophy & Approach

Welcome to Part 4, dedicated to the coaches who make the AARC Learn to Scull program possible! This chapter outlines the core philosophy, key teaching frameworks, and effective strategies to help you create a supportive, safe, and effective learning environment for new scullers.

### Creating a Positive Learning Environment

Your primary goal as a coach is not just to teach rowing technique but also to foster a love for the sport in a welcoming atmosphere. AARC adheres to principles of **Safety, Respect, and Kindness**, and these should guide all interactions. Here's how to cultivate that environment:

* **Foster Curiosity:** Create a space where questions are welcomed and encouraged. Normalize the learning process â€“ mishaps and challenges are expected.
* **Build Confidence:** Acknowledge effort and celebrate small successes. Break down complex skills into manageable steps, especially for anxious learners (e.g., the flip test).
* **Promote Respect:** Encourage peer support but maintain safety boundaries. Ensure all communication (yours and participants') is respectful and constructive, avoiding criticism of teammates' abilities.
* **Be Patient & Calm:** Maintain a calm, confident demeanor, especially when challenges arise. Your attitude sets the tone for the group.
* **Share Enthusiasm:** Let your passion for rowing show! Create moments for participants to simply enjoy being on the water and appreciate the surroundings. Balance technical instruction with the joy of the sport.

### Key Technical Frameworks

To ensure consistency and provide learners with memorable anchors, the AARC LTS program utilizes two core technical frameworks. Integrate these into your teaching and feedback:

#### KRAFT's Keys

Use these five principles as a foundation for technique correction:

* **K:** **K**eep shoulders relaxed and down (prevents tension, aids balance).
* **R:** **R**each from hips, not shoulders (promotes proper body angle and connection).
* **A:** **A**rms straight until legs are flat (ensures proper drive sequence).
* **F:** **F**eather after extraction (clean release, prepares for recovery).
* **T:** **T**ap down before extraction (facilitates clean blade release).

#### Black Bear Sequence (BBS)

This sequence breaks down the stroke cycle into manageable components for teaching:

1. **Grip and feather:** Correct hand position and blade control.
2. **Release:** Clean exit with light tap down at the finish.
3. **Recovery/Catch:** Sequenced return (arms â†’ body â†’ slide) to a prepared catch position.
4. **Drive:** Connected power application (legs â†’ back â†’ arms).
5. **Steering:** Frequent looks with subtle corrections.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Refer learners to these frameworks (found in their Q&A Companion) so they can reinforce their understanding between sessions. Use the keywords consistently in your coaching.

### Class Management Strategies (Coaching Approach)

Effective coaching involves more than just explaining technique. It requires strategic management of the learning process:

* **Focus:** Concentrate on one major technical point per rower per session. Resist the urge to overwhelm learners with too many corrections at once. Connect feedback to the KRAFT keys or BBS.
* **Communicate Clearly:** Use simple, consistent keywords linked to specific actions (e.g., "Legs!"). Use analogies and imagery (e.g., "Fingers like hooks," "Carrying a tray of drinks") to make concepts relatable.
* **Effective Feedback:** Provide specific, constructive feedback promptly. Balance corrections with positive reinforcement (the "feedback sandwich": positive observation, correction, positive encouragement). Focus on the *desired* action.
* **Adapt:** Tailor your teaching style to different learning modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic). Adjust the session plan based on group energy, skill level, and weather conditions.
* **Progress Logically:** Introduce skills in isolation before combining them. Start with stable environments (dock/erg) before moving to open water. Progress from slow, controlled movements to normal speed.
* **Manage Fear:** Acknowledge anxieties (especially around capsizing) without reinforcing them. Break down challenging skills and provide extra support initially, gradually reducing it as confidence builds.
* **Integrate Safety:** Weave safety instructions and reminders into every activity, rather than treating it as a separate topic. Reinforce relevant safety points (PFDs, boat handling, traffic patterns, weather) throughout each session.

    * **Immediate Debrief:** Gather group for feedback, highlight achievements, address challenges, preview next session, answer questions.
5. **Post-Session (After participants leave):**
    * **Admin Completion:** Update progress notes, document incidents, communicate with director, draft follow-up emails.
    * **Equipment Check:** Final inspection, report maintenance needs, secure facility/equipment.
    * **Self-Assessment:** Review session effectiveness, note what worked/didn't, identify adjustments needed.

ðŸ’¡ **Coach's Tip:** Make using the checklist a habit for every session. It prevents oversight and ensures all safety and logistical bases are covered. The Session-Specific section helps tailor preparation.

### Participant Assessment

At the end of the program (typically Session 4), it's important to assess each participant's readiness for unsupervised rowing or transitioning to other club programs like Open Sculling. The **Rower Assessment Checklist** (found within `Coach_Manual.md`) provides a standardized framework for this evaluation.

Review these points individually with rowers, providing constructive feedback.

#### Key Assessment Areas:

1. **Equipment Handling:**
    * Safe solo or partner carry.
    * Correct placement on/off racks/slings.
    * Follows pre-launch sequence (oars first, sign out).
    * Properly straps boat.
2. **Launching/Landing:**
    * Responds appropriately to dock commands.
    * Enters/exits boat safely at dock.
    * Approaches dock correctly (upstream, controlled speed).
3. **Basic Boat Control:**
    * Rows continuously with reasonable stability.
    * Demonstrates basic sequencing (armsâ†’bodyâ†’slide).
    * Applies noticeable leg drive.
    * Can perform basic one-armed and pivot turns.
4. **Navigation & Safety:**
    * Actively looks over shoulder (approx. every 3-5 strokes).
    * Maintains correct (starboard) river position.
    * Demonstrates awareness of surroundings.
    * Understands basic bridge traffic rules.
5. **Capsize Recovery:**
    * Successfully completed flip test (re-entry).
    * *OR* If re-entry failed, demonstrated ability to stay calm and swim boat towards safety. (Note PFD requirement if applicable).
6. **Post-Rowing:**
    * Properly cleans and stores equipment.
    * Knows how to report equipment issues (logbook).

This checklist helps ensure a consistent standard and provides clear feedback to learners about their progress and readiness for next steps.

### Communication Templates Guide
