# Safety Leadership

This chapter covers the critical role of coaches as safety leaders in the Learn to Scull program, including risk assessment, emergency response procedures, and weather-related decision making.

## Risk Assessment

Effective sculling safety begins with thorough risk assessment before and during sessions.

### Environmental Assessment
- **Water Conditions:** Check current speed, water level, turbidity, and debris
- **Traffic Patterns:** Assess other water users (power boats, kayakers, other rowers)
- **Access Points:** Identify available dock spaces, launch areas, and emergency exit points
- **Seasonal Factors:** Consider season-specific risks (cold water, algae blooms, summer recreational traffic)

### Equipment Risk Evaluation
- **Boat Inspection:** Check hull integrity, working foot stretchers, secure riggers and hardware
- **Safety Equipment:** Verify PFDs, safety whistle, first aid kit, and communication devices
- **Coach's Launch:** Ensure launch is operational with adequate fuel and safety equipment
- **Participant Equipment:** Check for appropriate clothing, footwear, and water bottles

### Participant Risk Factors
- **Swimming Ability:** Confirm self-reported swimming capability
- **Medical Concerns:** Note relevant health conditions (asthma, heart conditions, etc.)
- **Experience Level:** Adjust supervision based on demonstrated skill and confidence
- **Physical Limitations:** Accommodate specific needs or restrictions

### Dynamic Risk Assessment
- **Continuous Observation:** Monitor changing conditions throughout the session
- **Hazard Identification:** Stay alert for new hazards (approaching storms, debris, other traffic)
- **Group Capability:** Reassess participant energy, focus, and skill during session
- **Risk Mitigation:** Implement appropriate controls (course modification, intensified supervision)

## Emergency Response

Preparedness and clear procedures ensure effective response to emergency situations.

### Emergency Preparation
- **Communication Plan:** Establish reliable communication methods (cell phones, marine radios)
- **Emergency Contacts:** Maintain updated list of emergency services and key club contacts
- **Access Information:** Know exact location information and access points for emergency services
- **First Aid Readiness:** Maintain properly stocked and accessible first aid kits

### Capsize Management
- **Immediate Response:** Position launch quickly but safely near capsized boat
- **Participant Check:** Verify rower is conscious and responsive
- **Recovery Options:** Assess whether self-recovery is possible or assistance is needed
- **Hypothermia Prevention:** Remove from water quickly, provide dry clothing and warmth

### Medical Emergencies
- **Initial Assessment:** Evaluate consciousness, breathing, and circulation
- **First Aid Application:** Administer appropriate first aid while awaiting emergency services
- **Communication Protocol:** Contact emergency services with clear location and condition information
- **Documentation:** Record incident details, actions taken, and outcomes

### Environmental Emergencies
- **Sudden Weather:** Implement rapid return to dock or proceed to nearest safe shore
- **Lightning Protocol:** Clear water immediately, seek appropriate shelter
- **Flash Flooding:** Move to higher ground, account for all participants
- **Debris or Hazard Encounter:** Assist affected boats, warn others in area

### Post-Emergency Actions
- **Group Management:** Ensure all other participants are safe and supervised
- **Family Notification:** Contact emergency contacts when appropriate
- **Incident Documentation:** Complete detailed incident reports
- **Debrief and Review:** Evaluate response effectiveness and identify improvements

## Weather Decision-Making

Weather is a primary safety factor requiring careful monitoring and decisive action.

### Pre-Session Weather Evaluation
- **Forecast Review:** Check reliable forecasts from multiple sources
- **Radar Monitoring:** Review current radar images for approaching systems
- **Lightning Tracker:** Use lightning tracking applications when storms possible
- **Decision Timeline:** Make preliminary go/no-go decision 2 hours before, final check 30 minutes before

### Critical Weather Parameters
- **Wind Speed Thresholds:** Establish clear wind speed limits (generally 12-15 mph sustained)
- **Lightning Policy:** Define distance/time thresholds (typically 30/30 rule - 30 seconds between lightning and thunder means clear water)
- **Visibility Standards:** Set minimum visibility requirements (typically 100+ meters)
- **Temperature Considerations:** Adjust for combined air/water temperature risks

### On-Water Weather Monitoring
- **Sky Observation:** Watch for developing cumulus clouds, darkening skies, or sudden wind shifts
- **Wind Indicators:** Monitor water surface patterns, flag movement, and trees
- **Communication Systems:** Maintain contact with boathouse about developing conditions
- **Alternative Landing Sites:** Know accessible shorelines if quick evacuation needed

### Weather-Related Decisions
- **Session Modification:** Alter session plans to remain closer to boathouse when conditions uncertain
- **Shortened Sessions:** Reduce on-water time when conditions marginally acceptable
- **Alternative Activities:** Prepare land-based options when water conditions unsafe
- **Cancellation Criteria:** Establish clear, non-negotiable standards for cancellation

### Communication of Weather Decisions
- **Advance Notice:** Provide as much warning as possible for potential weather impacts
- **Clear Messaging:** Communicate decisions definitively without ambiguity
- **Explanation:** Briefly explain rationale to enhance understanding and acceptance
- **Contingency Information:** Include alternative plans or makeup session details

## Safety Leadership Skills

Effective safety leadership requires specific skills and attitudes.

### Decisiveness and Authority
- **Clear Direction:** Provide unambiguous instructions in safety situations
- **Confidence:** Project calm confidence even in challenging circumstances
- **Boundary Setting:** Firmly enforce safety rules and limitations
- **Intervention Readiness:** Act quickly when unsafe behaviors or conditions arise

### Communication for Safety
- **Briefing Skills:** Conduct effective pre-session safety briefings
- **Clarity:** Use simple, direct language for safety instructions
- **Verification:** Confirm understanding through questions and observation
- **Escalation:** Increase volume and directness appropriately in emergencies

### Creating Safety Culture
- **Modeling:** Demonstrate proper safety practices consistently
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Acknowledge and praise good safety behaviors
