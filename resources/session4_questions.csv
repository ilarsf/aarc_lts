S4Q1,What is the main overall goal of Session 4: Navigation and Working Up River?,Winning a practice race,Integrating all previously learned skills for independent sculling,Learning basic rowing terms,Mastering the ergometer technique,2,"Session 4 focuses on putting all skills together, river navigation including bridges, and achieving independent sculling capability."
S4Q2,"Why might the group be divided in Session 4 (e.g., Bridge Ready vs. Skills Development)?",To separate friends who talk too much,To have a race between groups,To practice rowing in different types of boats,To allow coaches to focus on specific needs based on rower assessment,4,"Group division allows coaches to provide targeted instruction, such as bridge practice for confident navigators and skill refinement for others."
S4Q3,"What is a key safety rule when navigating through bridge arches, as emphasized in Session 4?",Stop rowing completely under the bridge,Maintain course through a designated arch and do not pass other boats within the arch,Pass other boats only if necessary,Speed up significantly,2,The bridge pattern involves using specific arches and strictly prohibits passing within the arches for safety.
S4Q4,What does 'Continuous Rowing with Navigation Focus' primarily aim to develop?,Maximum power output,Perfect blade work,The fastest possible stroke rate,The ability to row effectively while actively steering and monitoring surroundings,4,This activity integrates rowing technique with the constant demands of safe navigation and awareness.
S4Q5,What common error occurs when rowers focus too much on navigation or steering?,Technique deterioration,Rowing too slowly,Forgetting to breathe,Gripping the oars too lightly,1,Beginners often let their rowing technique suffer when they have to multitask with steering and looking around.
S4Q6,"For the group focusing on bridge passage, what is a key coaching cue when approaching the arch?","'Aim for the center of the arch, eyes up, commit to your line'",'Close your eyes and pull hard','Stop rowing and drift through','Follow the boat ahead very closely',1,"Coaching focuses on aiming for the center, looking up for clearance, and maintaining a steady course through the arch."
S4Q7,"If a rower consistently fails to stay on the correct (starboard) side of the river, especially around bends, what is the recommended coach action?",Discuss it after the row,Ask them to stop and wait,"Ignore it, they will learn eventually",Use whistle or megaphone to redirect immediately,4,"Maintaining the traffic pattern is crucial for safety, requiring immediate correction if a rower strays."
S4Q8,What skill refinement drill might be used in Session 4 for rowers struggling with the recovery sequence?,High-rate pieces,Legs-only rowing,Square blade rowing,Pause drills,4,Pause drills are specifically mentioned as a way to reinforce sequencing for the skills development group.
S4Q9,What is the purpose of the Rower Assessment conducted during or after Session 4?,To rank rowers from best to worst,To assign cleaning duties,To evaluate individual skill competency and provide feedback for next steps,To determine eligibility for elite programs,3,The assessment checks if rowers have achieved the necessary skills for safe independent or supervised rowing and informs recommendations.
S4Q10,What common navigation error involves looking only at the boat directly ahead?,Following too closely,"Fixating, rather than scanning and picking independent points",Rowing too straight,Cutting corners,2,"Rowers need to look beyond the boat in front to anticipate bends, traffic, and choose their own steering points."
S4Q11,What does 'independent sculling capability' imply by the end of Session 4?,The rower can race competitively,The rower can perform the flip test unassisted,The rower needs no further coaching,The rower can safely navigate and handle the boat without constant direct supervision,4,The goal is for the rower to demonstrate sufficient skill and awareness to row safely on their own or in less supervised groups.
S4Q12,What should a rower do if their technique starts to break down while they are focusing on steering?,"Try to integrate steering into the rhythm, perhaps focusing on 'one thought at a time'",Ask the coach to steer for them,Stop rowing completely,Ignore the technique and focus only on steering,1,The goal is integration. Cues like 'Find a rhythm' or 'One thought at a time' help manage the cognitive load.
S4Q14,"For the Skills Development group in Session 4, what type of drill might be used to reinforce correct recovery sequencing?",Legs-only rowing,Steering obstacle course,High-intensity race pieces,"Pause drills (e.g., arms away, body over)",4,Session 4 plan mentions that the Skills Development group might work on consistency using drills. Pause drills are specifically designed to reinforce correct sequencing during the recovery phase.
