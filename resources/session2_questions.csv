S2Q1,What is the primary focus of Session 2: Hitting the Water?,Developing maximum power on the ergometer,Transferring the erg stroke sequence to the boat and basic control,Advanced race strategy,Mastering the flip test,2,"Session 2 focuses on applying the learned stroke sequence from the erg to the water, emphasizing recovery sequence and basic boat handling."
S2Q2,What is the correct recovery sequence emphasized in Session 2?,Arms -> Slide -> Body,Arms -> Body -> Slide,Slide -> Body -> Arms,Body -> Arms -> Slide,2,"The correct recovery sequence is Arms away, then Body pivot forward, then Legs compress (Slide)."
S2Q3,What drill is specifically mentioned in Session 2 for transferring the recovery sequence from the erg to the water incrementally?,Pick Drill,Reverse Pick Drill,Continuous Rowing,Pause Drills,1,"The Pick Drill on water (starting arms-only, then adding body, then slide) is used to transfer the sequence gradually."
S2Q4,"What is the purpose of Pause Drills (e.g., Arms Away Pause, Body Over Pause) introduced in Session 2?",To enhance body awareness and control during recovery,To improve leg drive power,To increase rowing speed,To practice emergency stops,1,Pause drills help rowers internalize the correct timing and sequence of the recovery phase.
S2Q5,What common sequencing error do Pause Drills help prevent?,Not rotating the body enough,Bending knees before the hands are away or body is over,Pulling too hard with the arms,Leaning back too far at the finish,2,Pause drills explicitly reinforce getting the hands away and body pivoted before the knees bend.
S2Q6,"When launching a boat from the dock, which way should the bow typically point?",Perpendicular to the current,Angled downstream to allow current assist,Directly into the current,Slightly angled towards the shore,2,Launching downstream allows the current to assist in moving the boat away from the launch point smoothly.
S2Q7,What action should you prioritize first when preparing equipment for launching according to Session 2?,Get the oars down to the dock,Get the boat down,Adjust foot stretchers,Sign out the boat,1,Session 2 mentions 'Oars down first' as part of the equipment prep routine.
S2Q8,"What is a common cause of poor balance mentioned in Session 2, often correctable by a simple cue?",Sitting too high,Not enough leg drive,Uneven hand heights during recovery,Using oars that are too long,3,Uneven hand heights are cited as a common cause of boat tilt. The cue is 'Keep hands level'.
S2Q9,What is the recommended technique for basic turning discussed in Session 2?,Leaning the body heavily,Backing water firmly with both oars,Using the rudder,Taking gentle strokes with the outside oar while trailing the inside oar,4,Basic turning is taught by taking gentle strokes with the oar on the outside of the turn.
S2Q10,"What does 'catching a crab' mean in rowing, as mentioned in Session 2's common errors?",Hitting a submerged object,The oar getting stuck underwater during the stroke,Catching the boat ahead,Losing grip of the oar handle,2,"Catching a crab refers to the oar blade getting stuck underwater, often disrupting the stroke."
S2Q11,"Why is it important to relax, keep shoulders down, and use a light grip, especially when first learning on the water?",It prevents blisters,It allows for a faster stroke rate,It looks more professional,It helps maintain balance in the unstable boat,4,"Tensing up, high shoulders, and tight grips negatively affect balance in a sculling shell."
S2Q12,"When landing on the dock, how should you generally approach?","Quickly, parallel to dock","Quickly, perpendicular to dock","Quickly, perpendicular to dock","Slowly, angling slightly towards the dock",4,"Approaching downstream requires a slow, controlled angle towards the landing point on the dock."
S2Q13,What post-rowing task is emphasized at the end of Session 2?,Reviewing video footage,Completing a written test,Boat cleaning and proper storage,Planning the next workout,3,"Boat cleaning (e.g., wiping down tracks) and storage are key post-rowing maintenance tasks."
S2Q15,"When launching downstream, what is a key consideration regarding the current?",The current assists departure but requires careful angle control,The current helps push you away too quickly,You must fight the current,The current has no effect,1,"Launching downstream uses the current, but requires controlling the boat's angle relative to the flow for a smooth departure."
