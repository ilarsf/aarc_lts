S3Q1,What is the main technical focus of Session 3: Learning How to Push?,Advanced steering maneuvers,Mastering feathering technique,Developing effective leg drive and power application,Improving recovery sequence,3,"Session 3 focuses on developing the power phase, specifically initiating the drive with the legs."
S3Q2,Which drill is used on the water in Session 3 to specifically emphasize initiating the drive with the legs?,Reverse Pick Drill,Pick Drill,Square Blade Rowing,Pause Drills,1,"The Reverse Pick Drill (starting legs-only, then adding back, then arms) isolates and emphasizes the leg drive."
S3Q3,What common error involves the seat moving backward before the shoulders and handle at the start of the drive?,Weak leg drive,Opening the back too early,Skying the blades,Bum shoving,4,"Bum shoving is when the seat shoots back without the body/shoulders moving with it, indicating poor connection."
S3Q4,What is the recommended frequency for looking over your shoulder to check your course and surroundings?,Once per minute,Every 3-5 strokes,Only when turning,Every 10-15 strokes,2,Session 3 emphasizes looking around every 3-5 strokes for safety and navigation.
S3Q5,"According to standard river traffic patterns discussed in Session 3, which side of the river should you generally stay on?",The left (Port) side,Whichever side has less wind,The middle of the river,The right (Starboard) side,4,The standard traffic pattern requires staying to the starboard (right) side relative to your direction of travel.
S3Q6,What technique is taught in Session 3 for executing sharp turns or turning in confined spaces?,Dragging one oar,Using body lean only,"Wide, sweeping turns using one oar","Pivot Turns (one oar backing, one rowing forward)",4,"Pivot turns, involving backing one oar and rowing forward with the other, are taught for tight maneuvering."
S3Q7,What does the term 'connection' refer to in the context of the leg drive?,Connecting with your crewmates emotionally,"The feeling of pressure linking the foot stretcher, legs, back, and handle",Connecting the boat to the dock,Connecting the oars properly in the oarlocks,2,Connection refers to effectively linking the push from the legs through the body to the oar handles without slippage or sequencing errors.
S3Q8,What is a corrective cue for someone opening their back too early during the drive?,'Relax your shoulders','Lean further forward at the catch','Legs are halfway down BEFORE you swing the back','Pull harder with the arms',3,The cue emphasizes completing more of the leg drive before initiating the back swing.
S3Q10,What is the corrective cue for a rower who is primarily pulling with their arms instead of driving with their legs?,'Feather the blade earlier','Keep your arms bent','Push the foot stretchers away!','Swing your back more',3,This cue directly prompts the rower to initiate the drive with leg pressure.
S3Q11,Why is looking frequently over your shoulder considered critical for safety?,To see if the coach is watching,To rest your neck muscles,"To be aware of your position, potential hazards, and other boats",To check your technique,3,Constant awareness of surroundings is essential for collision avoidance and safe navigation.
S3Q12,"When practicing navigation, what should rowers aim for to maintain a straight course?","Making large, infrequent corrections",Looking only at the boat ahead,Picking a fixed point far ahead and aiming for it,Following the waves,3,Focusing on a distant point helps maintain a straighter course compared to only looking nearby.
S3Q13,"What does the 'hang' refer to, often mentioned in relation to the leg drive?","The feeling of suspending body weight off the handles at the catch, driven by leg pressure",Hanging back at the finish,Hanging onto the dock before launching,Hanging the oars on the rack,1,"'Hanging' off the handles implies using body weight effectively, connected to the leg drive at the beginning of the stroke."
S3Q14,"In Session 3, coaches contrast a 'good push' with a 'soft push' primarily to demonstrate...?",How to adjust the foot stretchers properly,The correct way to grip the oars,How to row silently,The feeling and effect of effective leg drive vs. insufficient connection,4,The 'good push' vs. 'soft push' demonstration aims to help rowers feel the difference between a well-connected leg drive that moves the boat effectively and a disconnected or weak push.
