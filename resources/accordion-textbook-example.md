      <h3>Welcome to AARC Learn to Scull!</h3>

      <p>Welcome! The Ann Arbor Rowing Club (AARC) invites you to experience the joy of rowing on Argo Pond. This textbook provides a comprehensive guide for our Learn to Scull program.</p>

      <h3>What is Sculling?</h3>

      <p>Sculling is a type of rowing where one person uses two oars (called sculls), one in each hand, to propel a narrow, lightweight boat called a shell.</p>

      <h3>Who is This Textbook For?</h3>

      <p>This resource is designed for two primary audiences:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adult Learners:</strong> Individuals new to rowing, those needing a refresher, or sweep rowers learning to scull. No prior experience is necessary!</li>
        <li><strong>Volunteer Coaches:</strong> Providing structured lesson plans, technical guidance, safety protocols, and class management tools.</li>
      </ul>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
      <p>The AARC Learn to Scull program is an introductory course designed to teach you the basics and get you comfortable on the water, preparing you for the next step in your rowing journey.</p>

      <h4>Key Program Features:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Progressive Skill Development:</strong> Each session builds logically on the previous one.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety-First Approach:</strong> Comprehensive training includes water safety, boat handling, and the essential flip test (capsize recovery).</li>
        <li><strong>Supportive Learning Environment:</strong> Small group instruction ensures personalized attention from experienced coaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Focus:</strong> Emphasis on developing proper technique from the very beginning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Weekend Intensive Format & Considerations:</h4>

      <p>Our program uses a weekend intensive format (4 sessions over 2 consecutive weekends, 8am-11am Sat/Sun). This immersive format accelerates learning but can be physically demanding.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pacing:</strong> Be prepared for multiple sessions per weekend.</li>
        <li><strong>Hand Care:</strong> Be proactive with blister prevention (See Part 2, Chapter 5).</li>
        <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Stay hydrated, eat well, and rest between sessions.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/course_materials/learner/Program_Schedule.html">Online Program Schedule</a> for more details on the format.</em></p>

      <h4>Learning Journey:</h4>

      <p>You'll progress through key stages:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Sessions 1-2: Fundamentals:</strong> Water safety, boat familiarity, basic rowing motion, boat handling, and the flip test.</li>
        <li><strong>Sessions 3-4: Integration & Application:</strong> Developing proper technique, applying power, navigation, refining the stroke, and building confidence for independent sculling.</li>
      </ol>

<div class="accordion-section">
  <button class="accordion-toggle">Physical Requirements & Expectations</button>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
      <p>While sculling is adaptable, certain physical abilities are needed for safety and participation:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Ability to get down to the floor and back up using only one hand (demonstrates mobility for getting in/out of the boat).</li>
        <li>Ability to turn your head to look over both shoulders (necessary for steering and safety checks).</li>
        <li>Swimming ability: Adults must attest they can swim.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Warning:</strong> Sculling uses muscles you might not use regularly! Expect some initial muscle soreness and potential hand blisters. Consistent practice and proper technique will build strength and resilience. See Part 2, Chapter 5 for prevention and treatment tips.</p>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
      <p>Now that you're familiar with the program, let's get you ready for your first exciting day on the water! This chapter covers the practical details you need to know before you arrive, what to bring, and what the environment at the boathouse is like.</p>

      <h3>Before You Arrive</h3>

      <p>A little preparation goes a long way to ensure a smooth start.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Waivers:</strong> Ensure you have signed and submitted the AARC liability waiver and the US Rowing waiver. These are typically handled during registration or sent via email beforehand. Contact the program administrator if you're unsure about the status of your waivers.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Check your email for any communications from your coaches, especially the "Welcome Email" and "Final Reminder". These often contain specific details about meeting points, weather updates, or last-minute instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Review:</strong> Briefly review Chapter 1 of this textbook and perhaps watch any introductory videos suggested by the coaches (links may be provided in emails or Appendix C).</li>
      </ul>

  <button class="accordion-toggle">What to Wear and Bring</button>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
      <p>Comfort and practicality are key for rowing.</p>

      <h4>What to Wear:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Wear form-fitting, athletic clothing that allows freedom of movement and won't get caught in the boat's sliding seat or tracks. Think leggings, athletic shorts (not too baggy), and moisture-wicking tops. Layers are good for cooler weather.</li>
        <li><strong>High-Visibility:</strong> For safety on the water, wear bright, visible colors (white, yellow, orange, or pink). Avoid dark colors that blend with water (black, navy, dark gray). This is a critical safety requirement.</li>
        <li><strong>Hand Safety:</strong> Trim your fingernails short to prevent scratching during the crossover motion in sculling, and remove rings and jewelry that can interfere with grip or cause injury.</li>
        <li><strong>Shoes:</strong> You'll wear athletic shoes to the boathouse for land activities. You will typically remove your shoes before getting into the rowing shell, which has built-in foot stretchers.</li>
        <li><strong>Socks:</strong> Recommended for comfort in the boat's foot stretchers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>What to Bring:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water Bottle:</strong> Absolutely essential! Bring a large water bottle (at least 1 liter / 32 oz recommended). Staying hydrated is crucial.</li>
        <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Sunscreen (SPF 30+, water-resistant), a hat with a brim, and sunglasses are highly recommended, even on cloudy days. Water reflects sunlight!</li>
        <li><strong>Towel & Change of Clothes:</strong> You <em>will</em> get wet during the flip test in the first session.</li>
        <li><strong>Required Forms:</strong> Bring any outstanding forms (like waivers) if requested.</li>
        <li><strong>Snacks:</strong> Optional, but useful for the break, especially during the weekend intensive format.</li>
        <li><strong>Enthusiasm!</strong> A positive attitude and willingness to learn are your most important assets.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid loose jewelry that could get caught. If you wear glasses, consider a strap to keep them secure.</p>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> The AARC boathouse is located at Bandemer Park. Your pre-course communication should specify the exact meeting point.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrival Time:</strong> Please arrive 15 minutes early for your <em>first</em> session. This allows time for introductions, orientation, and checking in without rushing. For subsequent sessions, arriving 5-10 minutes early is usually sufficient.</li>
        <li><strong>Facilities:</strong> Be aware that our boathouse location at Bandemer Park does <em>not</em> have dedicated locker rooms or changing facilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Space:</strong> AARC shares the space with other programs and the public. Be considerate, keep pathways clear, and follow instructions from your coaches regarding equipment storage and movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Listening:</strong> When coaches or coxswains are speaking, especially during boat handling or on the dock, please listen attentively and refrain from side conversations. Clear communication is vital for safety.</li>
