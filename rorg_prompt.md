I need assistance implementing the content reorganization plan for the AARC Learn to Scull Program website. The plan details are in content_reorganization_plan.md. 

Please help me with the following tasks:

1. Create the directory structure for the [specific section, e.g., "for-learners/getting-started/"] as outlined in the plan (`content_reorganization_plan.md`).

2. Create the required markdown files for this section with appropriate front matter, following Jekyll conventions.

3. Extract and reorganize relevant content from these existing files:
   - [list specific source files based on the inventory in the plan]

4. For each new file:
   - Ensure it has correct front matter (layout, title, etc.)
   - Consolidate duplicate information
   - Organize content in a logical progression
   - Update internal links to use the new file structure
   - Maintain consistent styling and formatting

5. When migrating content:
   - Preserve all important information
   - Eliminate redundancies
   - Improve clarity and organization
   - Structure content with proper headings and sections
   - Add appropriate navigation elements (breadcrumbs, next/previous links)

6. Update the content_reorganization_plan.md checklist to reflect completed items.

Please show me the complete implementation for this section, including:
- Terminal commands to create directories
- Full content of each new markdown file
- Explanation of what content was used from which source files

Let's work methodically, one section at a time, starting with [chosen section].
