# Program Overview

Welcome to the Learn to Scull program! This guide will help you understand what to expect throughout your sculling journey, from your first day to your final assessment.

## Program Structure

<div class="info-box note">
  <h4>Weekend Intensive Format</h4>
  <p>The AARC Learn to Scull program uses a weekend intensive format, delivering the complete curriculum over two consecutive weekends. This format is designed for efficient skill development while accommodating busy schedules.</p>
</div>

The program consists of 4 sessions (3 hours each) scheduled across two consecutive weekends:

<div class="two-col-grid">
  <div>
    <h3>Weekend 1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Saturday:</strong> Session 1 (8:00-11:00am)</li>
      <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> Session 2 (8:00-11:00am)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h3>Weekend 2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Saturday:</strong> Session 3 (8:00-11:00am)</li>
      <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> Session 4 (8:00-11:00am)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note: Each session includes a short break. Remember to bring your own water and snacks.</em></p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="info-box warning">
  <h4>Physical Considerations</h4>
  <p>This intensive format can be physically demanding, especially for those new to rowing. Participants should be prepared for:</p>
  <ul class="mb-0">
    <li>Multiple sessions in a single day during the first weekend</li>
    <li>Hand sensitivity and potential blister development</li>
    <li>Possibility of bruising during the flip test, particularly on legs, torso, and arms</li>
    <li>Cumulative fatigue across consecutive days of learning</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Learning Milestones

Your journey will progress through these key milestones:

### Milestone 1: Water Safety and Boat Familiarity
- Successfully complete the flip test
- Understand basic terminology
- Enter and exit the boat with assistance
- Develop comfort with the rowing position

### Milestone 2: Basic Technique Development
- Maintain balance in the boat
- Execute the basic rowing stroke
- Control direction using pressure adjustments
- Enter and exit the boat independently

### Milestone 3: Skill Refinement
- Coordinate the full rowing sequence
- Transition between square and feathered blades
- Develop efficient power application
- Row continuously for extended periods

### Milestone 4: Independence
- Launch and dock independently
- Navigate the rowing course with confidence

## Equipment Overview

During the program, you'll be introduced to these essential components:

- **Single scull**: A narrow, lightweight boat propelled by two oars
- **Oars (sculls)**: Two identical oars, one for each hand
- **PFD**: Personal flotation device, required safety equipment
- **Clothing**: Athletic, moisture-wicking clothes that allow movement

## Weather Contingencies

<div class="info-box">
  <h4>Schedule Adjustments</h4>
  <p>Rowing is weather-dependent. If sessions need to be canceled due to unsafe conditions (lightning, excessive wind, or heavy rain), we will schedule make-up sessions as needed.</p>
</div>

The following conditions may impact our ability to hold on-water sessions:
- Lightning or thunderstorms within viewing or hearing distance
- Sustained winds over 12 mph or wind gusts over 15 mph
- Heavy rain that affects visibility
- Fog that reduces visibility below 100 meters
- Unsafe water conditions (excessive current, debris, or contamination)

We recommend keeping the following weekend partially open as a contingency for weather-related rescheduling.

## Assessment and Progress Tracking

Throughout the program, coaches will assess your progress in these key areas:
- Safety awareness and practices
- Technical proficiency
- Boat handling and navigation
- Independence and confidence

You can also track your own progress through session quizzes:
