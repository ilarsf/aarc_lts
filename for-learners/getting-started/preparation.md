# What to Bring and Wear

Proper preparation will help you have a comfortable, safe, and enjoyable experience during your Learn to Scull program. This guide covers everything you need to bring to each session and how to dress appropriately for rowing.

## Essential Items for Every Session

### Hydration and Nutrition
- **Large Water Bottle:** At least 32 oz (1 liter) - rowing is physically demanding and you'll need to stay hydrated
- **Small Snack:** Something light for energy during the session break (energy bar, fruit, etc.)

### Sun Protection
- **Waterproof Sunscreen:** The water reflects sunlight, increasing exposure
- **Hat with Brim:** Protects your face and improves visibility
- **Sunglasses:** Ideally with a strap to prevent loss if they fall off
- **Lip Balm with SPF:** Optional but recommended

### Required Safety Items
- **Completed Forms:** AARC and USRowing waivers (especially for your first session)
- **Medication:** If needed (e.g., asthma inhaler, EpiPen), in a waterproof container

### For Session 1 (Flip Test)
- **Towel:** Full-size to dry off after the flip test
- **Complete Change of Clothes:** You will get wet during the supervised flip test
- **Plastic Bag:** For wet clothes after the flip test

### Optional Items
- **Hand Care Supplies:** Athletic tape or blister kit if you're prone to blisters
- **Small Dry Bag:** To keep valuables dry (phone, keys)
- **Hair Ties:** For long hair

## What to Wear for Rowing

### Clothing Guidelines
- **Athletic, Form-Fitting Clothing:** Wear moisture-wicking garments that won't catch in the sliding seat tracks
- **AVOID Baggy Clothing:** Loose clothing can get caught in moving parts of the boat
- **HIGH VISIBILITY Colors:** Wear bright colors (neon yellow, orange, pink, white) for safety on the water
- **AVOID Dark Colors:** Dark colors (black, navy, dark gray) blend with water and reduce visibility
- **Layers:** In cooler weather, wear layers that can be easily removed as you warm up
- **No Cotton:** Choose synthetic fabrics that dry quickly

### Footwear
- **Athletic Shoes:** Wear regular athletic shoes to the boathouse for warm-up activities
- **Socks:** You'll wear socks in the boat's built-in foot stretchers (shoes stay on shore)
- **No Street Shoes:** Street shoes are never allowed in the boats

### Hand Protection
- **Remove Rings and Jewelry:** These can cause blisters and may catch on equipment
- **Cut Fingernails Short:** Long nails can cause scratches to your opposite hand
- **Optional Gloves:** Rowing-specific gloves can help prevent blisters for beginners

## Preparing Your Body

### Before Your First Session
- **Trim Fingernails:** Keep them short and smooth
- **Remove Jewelry:** Take off rings, bracelets, and watches that might interfere with rowing
- **Basic Stretching:** Light stretching, especially for shoulders, back, and legs
- **Rest Well:** Ensure you're well-rested to maximize learning and endurance

### Between Sessions
- **Hand Care:** Treat any developing blisters according to the [Hand Care Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/Rowers_Hand_Blister_Treatment.html)
- **Gentle Recovery:** Light stretching if you're sore from previous sessions
- **Mental Preparation:** Review techniques and terminology from previous sessions

## Facility Information

- **Location:** Meet at the Bandemer Park boathouse (check pre-course emails for exact meeting spot)
- **Arrival Time:** 15 minutes early for your first session, 5-10 minutes early for subsequent sessions
- **Facilities Note:** There are no dedicated locker rooms or changing facilities at Bandemer Park
- **Weather Contingency:** Sessions may be rescheduled due to unsafe conditions; check your email before heading to the boathouse if weather is questionable

Remember that sculling is a water sport - you will get wet at some point! Having proper clothing and being prepared for all conditions will make your learning experience much more enjoyable.
