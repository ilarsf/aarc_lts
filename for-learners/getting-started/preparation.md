            <p>Please bring the following items to each session:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Bottle:</strong> Staying hydrated is crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunscreen:</strong> Protect your skin, even on cloudy days.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunglasses:</strong> Polarized sunglasses are best for reducing glare off the water.</li>
                <li><strong>Hat or Visor:</strong> For sun protection and to keep hair out of your eyes.</li>
                <li><strong>Towel:</strong> For drying off after the session or if you get wet.</li>
                <li><strong>Change of Clothes (optional):</strong> You might want dry clothes for after the flip test.</li>

        <div class="accordion-content-inner">
            <p>Choose comfortable, athletic clothing that allows for a full range of motion and won't interfere with equipment. Safety and visibility are key.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Close-Fitting Athletic Wear:</strong> Opt for items like bike shorts, leggings, or fitted athletic tops. Loose clothing (baggy shorts/tops) can get caught in the sliding seat or oars.</li>
                <li><strong>Moisture-Wicking Fabrics:</strong> Synthetics (polyester, nylon, spandex) are best as they dry quickly. Avoid cotton, which stays wet.</li>
                <li><strong>Layers:</strong> Be prepared for changing weather with layers you can add or remove. A light windbreaker or waterproof jacket is useful.</li>
                <li><strong>Bright Colors:</strong> High-visibility clothing (e.g., neon yellow, orange, bright green) is strongly recommended to make you more visible on the water.</li>
                <li><strong>Socks:</strong> You'll typically row in socks. Bring socks that can get damp.</li>
                <li><strong>Shoes for Land:</strong> Wear athletic shoes (sneakers/trainers) for land activities and carrying equipment. You'll remove them before entering the boat.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Safety is our top priority. Always remember:</p>

                <li><strong>Inform Coaches of Concerns:</strong> If you have any medical conditions, are not a strong swimmer, or have any concerns, please inform your coach before getting on the water.</li>
                <li><strong>PFDs (Personal Flotation Devices):</strong> Your coach will instruct you on PFD usage. If you are not a confident swimmer or feel uncomfortable, request a PFD.</li>
                <li><strong>Buddy System:</strong> Stay with the group and be aware of your fellow rowers.</li>
                <li><strong>Handling Equipment:</strong> Learn the proper techniques for handling boats and oars to prevent injury and equipment damage. Always ask for help if you are unsure.</li>
                <li><strong>Flip Test:</strong> You will participate in a supervised capsize drill (flip test) to learn how to recover if your boat overturns. This is a crucial safety skill.</li>

            <ul>

            </ul>
