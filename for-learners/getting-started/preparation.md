        <div class="accordion-content-inner">
            <p>Please bring the following items to each session:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Bottle:</strong> Staying hydrated is crucial. A reusable water bottle is recommended.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunscreen:</strong> Protect your skin, even on cloudy days.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunglasses:</strong> Polarized sunglasses are best for reducing glare off the water.</li>
                <li><strong>Hat or Visor:</strong> For sun protection and to keep hair out of your eyes.</li>
                <li><strong>Towel:</strong> For drying off after the session or if you get wet.</li>
                <li><strong>Change of Clothes (optional):</strong> You might want dry clothes for after the session.</li>
                <li><strong>Small Waterproof Bag (optional):</strong> To protect small personal items like keys or a phone if you choose to bring them on the water (at your own risk). Coaches are not responsible for personal belongings.</li>

    <button class="accordion-toggle">What to Wear</button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <div class="accordion-content-inner">
            <p>Appropriate attire is important for comfort, safety, and preventing damage to equipment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Form-Fitting Clothing:</strong> Loose clothing, especially baggy shorts or tops, can get caught in the sliding seat or oars. Opt for athletic wear such as bike shorts, leggings, or close-fitting athletic pants and tops.</li>
                <li><strong>Moisture-Wicking Fabrics:</strong> Choose synthetic fabrics (polyester, nylon, spandex) that dry quickly and pull moisture away from your skin. Avoid cotton, as it absorbs water and stays wet.</li>
                <li><strong>Layers:</strong> Weather can change quickly. Dress in layers that you can easily add or remove. A lightweight windbreaker or waterproof jacket can be useful.</li>
                <li><strong>Bright Colors:</strong> High-visibility clothing (neon yellow, orange, bright green) is strongly recommended to make you more visible to other boaters and coaches on the water.</li>
                <li><strong>Socks:</strong> You will typically row in your socks or barefoot in the boat's foot stretchers. Bring socks you don't mind getting damp.</li>
                <li><strong>Shoes for Land:</strong> Wear athletic shoes (sneakers/trainers) to the boathouse for land-based activities and carrying equipment. You will remove them before getting into the rowing shell.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Baggy clothing</li>
                <li>Jeans or restrictive street clothes</li>
                <li>Clothing with zippers or buttons that could scratch the boat</li>
                <li>Excessive jewelry that could get caught or lost</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Familiarize yourself with parking options near the boathouse. Parking can be limited, so allow extra time if needed.</li>

                <li><strong>Restrooms:</strong> Know where the restrooms are located. It's a good idea to use them before the session begins.</li>
