# Sculling Safety

Safety is the most important aspect of rowing. This section covers essential safety information that every rower must understand before getting on the water.

## Safety Resources

- [Essential Rules](essential-rules.md) - Core safety rules every sculler must follow
- [Self-Rescue](self-rescue.md) - What to do if you flip your boat
- [River Traffic](river-traffic.md) - Navigation patterns and rules on the water
- [Weather Guidelines](weather-guidelines.md) - How weather affects rowing safety

Every rower is responsible for their own safety and contributes to the safety of others. Take time to thoroughly review and understand these materials. Safety knowledge is just as important as rowing technique when it comes to becoming an independent sculler.
