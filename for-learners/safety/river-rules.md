        <h1><i class="fas fa-water"></i> River Rules & Safety</h1>
        <p class="lead">Navigating the Huron River safely and courteously is essential for all AARC members.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        <h4 class="alert-heading"><i class="fas fa-bullhorn"></i> Key Principle: Stay Right, Pass Left</h4>
        <p>River rules are essentially the same as road rules: <strong>Stay on the right side of the river and pass on the left.</strong> However, always be prepared to adapt based on conditions and coach instructions.</p>

            <h2><i class="fas fa-users"></i> Sharing the River</h2>
            <p>We share the river with Pioneer, Huron, and U-M menâ€™s crew teams, plus canoers, kayakers, paddle-boarders, and sometimes swimmers. Be aware and courteous.</p>
            <p>There are some shallow areas near shore; avoid getting too close to the shoreline.</p>

            <hr class="my-4">

            <h2><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> Turning at Dams/Bridges (River Turn)</h2>
            <p>All boats should use a <strong>river turn</strong> at dams or bridges:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stay on the right side of the river.</li>
                <li>Come to a stop (e.g., under power wires near the dam).</li>
                <li>Turn 90 degrees to the left.</li>
                <li>Row across the river.</li>
                <li>Turn another 90 degrees to the left.</li>
                <li>Wait in a safe area for the coach to tell you to resume.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Example near the dam:</strong> Row until under power wires, stop, make your river turn, row across until even with the island, turn again, and take strokes to clear the turning area for others. If other boats are turning, the boat closest to shore should go further (like an outside lane on a track).</p>

            <hr class="my-4">

            <h2><i class="fas fa-ship"></i> Navigating Other River Users</h2>
            <p>Kayaks, canoes, paddle-boards, and fishermen may not follow traffic rules and can be unpredictable. Be cautious and prioritize safety. Steer around them if possible, or stop if necessary. Always be courteous.</p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-swimmer"></i> Swimmers</h3>
            <p>Swimmers can be a hazard, especially in summer. They are hard to see and unpredictable. Be watchful past the dock. You may need to row further from shore or stop to ensure a safe path.</p>

            <hr class="my-4">

            <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Hazards</h2>
            <h3><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Weeds</h3>
            <p>Weeds become more prevalent as summer progresses, usually visible along the shoreline (especially around the big bend downriver). Avoid steering into them as oars can get caught, making navigation difficult. Your coach can offer tips.</p>
