                <p>The process for joining AARC typically involves these steps, especially after completing a Learn to Scull program:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Complete Learn to Scull (or equivalent):</strong> For new rowers, successful completion of the LTS program and certification by coaches is usually the first step. Experienced rowers transferring from other clubs may have a different pathway – please contact us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open Sculling Program Trial (Recommended):</strong> Participate in the four-week trial to transition smoothly into club rowing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Submit Membership Application:</strong> Fill out the official AARC membership application form (available online or from the club).</li>
                    <li><strong>Pay Annual Dues:</strong> Submit payment for the applicable membership category.</li>

                    <li><strong>USRowing Membership:</strong> Ensure you have an active USRowing membership (Basic membership is often included with LTS; an upgrade might be needed for full competitive membership). AARC will guide you on this.</li>
