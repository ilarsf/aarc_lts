            <h3 class="mt-4">SafeSport Training Details</h3>
            <p>All team sports in the United States participate in the SafeSport program, designed to protect young athletes. While AARC is primarily a master's club, we do have minor members and employ minor coxswains. Every USRowing member must attest to whether they are in regular contact with minors. Those who are must complete SafeSport training (approx. 90 minutes initially, 30 minutes for annual renewal).</p>
            <p>Access SafeSport training videos <a href="https://usrowing.org/sports/2022/12/20/accessing-safesport-training.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer">here <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>.</p>

            <p>Members are expected to contribute to keep the club running smoothly and cost-effectively. Opportunities are advertised in "The Weekly Catch" or via SignUp Genius (accessible on the homepage under “Stewardship”).</p>
            <p><strong>Types of Duties:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weekly Tasks:</strong> Boathouse sweeping, laundering towels, etc.</li>

            <h2>Winter Training</h2>
            <p>Once the on-the-water season concludes, the Winter Training program (on ergometers) begins. This program is for all rowers (sweep and sculling) and helps develop power, fitness, and stroke mechanics under closer coach observation.</p>
            <p>Coached practices typically run on weekday mornings/evenings and one weekend session from December through March. The location varies and will be announced in "The Catch". Sign-ups are also advertised there and available via the website.</p>
