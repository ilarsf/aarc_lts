<p>Wear form-fitting, moisture-wicking clothes that allow freedom of movement. Avoid baggy shorts or pants that might catch on equipment. Many rowers prefer specialized rowing shorts with reinforced seats, but any athletic shorts will work initially. In cooler weather, dress in layers that can be removed as you warm up.</p>

                    <div class="nested-content-inner">
<p>Bright, high-visibility clothing (neon yellow, orange, red) is strongly recommended for safety reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Makes you easier to spot by other watercraft, especially in low light conditions</li>
  <li>Increases visibility if you need assistance on the water</li>
  <li>Helps coaches identify individuals in a group of scullers</li>
  <li>Essential during early morning or evening practices when light is limited</li>

                    <div class="nested-content-inner">
<p>No, rowing shells have built-in foot stretchers with shoes or foot holders. You'll remove your regular shoes before getting in the boat. However, wear athletic shoes to the boathouse for warm-up activities.</p>

<p>Rowing is accessible to people of varying fitness levels. The Learn to Scull program focuses on technique rather than endurance or power. Basic fitness that allows 1-2 hours of light to moderate activity is sufficient. If you have specific concerns about physical limitations, discuss them with your coach before the first session.</p>

                <button class="nested-toggle">Will I capsize during Learn to Scull?</button>
                <div class="nested-content">
                    <div class="nested-content-inner">
<p>While capsizing is possible, it's not common. The program uses stable training shells, and coaches provide careful instruction on balance. You'll complete a supervised "flip test" (intentional capsize and recovery) in a controlled environment to build confidence in water safety.</p>

                <div class="nested-content">
                    <div class="nested-content-inner">
<p>The flip test is a supervised capsize recovery drill that teaches you how to safely re-enter your boat after it has capsized. It's a mandatory safety requirement for all AARC scullers for several important reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensures you know what to do in case of an accidental capsize</li>
  <li>Reduces anxiety about capsizing once you know you can recover</li>
  <li>Must be successfully completed to graduate from the Learn to Scull program</li>
  <li>Required to participate in the Open Sculling Program and use club equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>The test is typically scheduled during Session 1, but if needed, you'll have opportunities to complete it in Sessions 2, 3, or 4.</p>

                <div class="nested-content">
                    <div class="nested-content-inner">
<p>Yes, with some precautions. Inform your coach about your swimming ability. You'll be required to wear a PFD (personal flotation device) during on-water sessions. The boats stay in protected water areas, and coaches maintain close supervision.</p>

                <div class="nested-content">
                    <div class="nested-content-inner">
<p>Blisters are common for new rowers as hands adapt to the friction of the oar handles. They typically diminish as you develop calluses and improve your grip technique. To minimize blisters: maintain a relaxed grip (avoid "white knuckling" the oars), ensure proper hand position, and gradually increase rowing duration. Athletic tape can protect vulnerable areas.</p>

                <div class="nested-content">
                    <div class="nested-content-inner">
<p>Balance challenges are normal for beginners. Focus on these key elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Relaxation: Tension in your upper body makes balancing harder</li>
  <li>Hand heights: Keep your hands at consistent heights</li>
  <li>Body position: Maintain a vertical spine with shoulders relaxed</li>
  <li>Core engagement: Use your core muscles for stability</li>
  <li>Slower movements: Avoid sudden shifts in weight</li>

                <div class="nested-content">
                    <div class="nested-content-inner">
<p>A "crab" occurs when your blade gets stuck in the water. To prevent this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure clean blade extraction at the finish</li>
  <li>Maintain proper blade depth (not too deep)</li>
  <li>Use appropriate pressure for your skill level</li>
  <li>Focus on consistent hand heights</li>
  <li>Practice proper feathering and squaring technique</li>
</ul>

                <div class="nested-content">
                    <div class="nested-content-inner">
<p>Keeping arms straight during the initial drive ensures you're using your legs (your most powerful muscles) efficiently. Bending arms too early "disconnects" your leg power from the oar. Remember the sequence: push with legs first, then lean back slightly, and finally draw with arms.</p>

<p>Coaches assign equipment based on:</p>
<ul>

  <li>Your skill level and experience</li>
  <li>Equipment availability and condition</li>
  <li>Specific learning goals for each session</li>

                <div class="nested-content">
                    <div class="nested-content-inner">
<p>Yes, but only with coach assistance initially. Proper foot stretcher position is crucial for comfortable rowing and optimal power application. Your coach will help you find the right position for your height and proportions.</p>

                <div class="nested-content">
                    <div class="nested-content-inner">
<p>In sculling, each rower uses two oars (one in each hand). In sweep rowing, each rower uses a single oar (held with both hands). The Learn to Scull program focuses exclusively on sculling, which provides an excellent foundation in rowing fundamentals.</p>

                    <div class="nested-content-inner">
<p>Single sculls can be carried by one person, but beginners often use a buddy system for safety. To carry a single:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stand at the boat's midpoint (balance point)</li>
  <li>Lift by gripping the gunwales or shell near the riggers</li>
  <li>Raise to shoulder height with the upper flange (top edge) against your shoulder</li>
  <li>Keep boat level and watch for obstacles, especially the riggers</li>
  <li>Communicate clearly with coaches or helpers</li>
  <li>When putting the boat down, reverse the process with controlled movements</li>

<p>Because the program builds skills sequentially, missing a session can impact your progress. If you must miss a session, inform your coach as soon as possible. Make-up options depend on availability but might include:</p>
<ul>
