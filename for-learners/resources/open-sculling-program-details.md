    <h2>Phase 2 of LTS: Open Sculling Trial Period</h2>
    <p>In the first four sessions of the Learn-to-Scull class (Phase 1), your coach(es) oriented you to the technique of rowing and some of the terms, rules, and etiquette of the sport. In Phase 2, you will join the Open Sculling Program to further improve technique, skill, and stamina in rowing. This document is designed to help you with the logistics that you will need to know for this phase.</p>

    <h3>A. How to sign-up to continue with Phase 2</h3>
    <p>If you wish to continue with AARC after the LTS class, you can join the Open Sculling Program for a four-week trial period. This trial phase requires payment of a program fee; please see the <a href="https://aarc.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=757878&module_id=201828">AARC LTS webpage</a> for current fee details. Please note there is no flexibility on which 4 weeks are offered at this rate. The Open Sculling Program is designed to help scullers further develop and master their skills, and is suitable for recent LTS graduates, experienced scullers aiming to refine their technique, and adults returning to the sport of rowing after a long hiatus.</p>
    <p>Your LTS coaches will provide details on how to sign up for this trial during your final session.</p>

    <h3>B. Weekly Sign-up</h3>
    <p>You need to sign up each week for the sculling practice sessions you want to row. <strong>Your request needs to be placed by Thursday at noon to row the following week.</strong> To do this, login to <a href="https://aarc.clubexpress.com/">https://aarc.clubexpress.com/ <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> and from the <strong>homepage</strong> (scroll down, left column), select “<strong>Sculling Weekly Request to Row Signup</strong>” and follow the link. Note that there is more than one week available; you may sign up for one week at a time or for all weeks listed (although we recommend only signing up for the following week, in case your schedule changes). Please note that even if you choose “row” for a particular session, you may be listed in the “available” section of the boatings if not enough boats are available. For visual instructions on where to find this information, click <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XFdRQoETMIfzRkMaXHX8E3MYlUcEORY_QQ6BTEuQNJI/edit?usp=sharingv_YvDnP6ZIe5nnOa0/edit?usp=sharing">here <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>.</p>

    <h3>C. Check the website to see when you are boated</h3>
    <p>Check back on Sunday to see when you are scheduled to row. To do this, login to <a href="https://aarc.clubexpress.com/">https://aarc.clubexpress.com/ <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> and from the homepage, under “Weekly Schedule,” (scroll down and look at the left column) select “Current Week’s Schedule,” and open the tab in the schedule for “Sculling”.</p>

    <h3>D. Come down to the river and row!</h3>
    <p><strong>Note: If you are assigned a boat, please show up or let the coach know.</strong> Many people are looking to participate in our practices and we have limited equipment so please let the coach know if you are boated and cannot be there so that another rower may use the equipment.</p>

    <h3>E. Arrival Times</h3>
    <p><strong>It is very important to show up to practices on time.</strong> “On time” means 15 minutes before practice begins in order to prepare the equipment. For most of the summer that means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>6:15 pm</strong> for Monday/Wednesday evening sessions</li>
        <li><strong>6:45 am</strong> for Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday morning sessions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When rowers are on time, we can be prepared for the water at practice time. Coaches can then launch rowers together for productive practices.</p>

    <h3>F. If you can’t make it to your scheduled practice</h3>
    <p>Of course, things come up unexpectedly and sometimes you just can’t make it. If you need to miss a practice last minute please also email the coach in charge of the practice and let them know so that equipment can be reassigned and other rowers accommodated; the coaches are also found in the membership directory.</p>

    <h3>G. Inclement Weather</h3>
    <p>If practice needs to be canceled due to inclement weather, the coaches will send out an email 30 minutes before practice, if at all possible. In most cases, practice will be shifted to an indoor erg workout at the boathouse.</p>

    <h2>Continuing with the Open Sculling Program After the Trial Phase</h2>
    <p>Have you caught the rowing bug? We hope that you enjoyed your Learn-to-Scull experience and that you consider continuing on with AARC. After your four-week trial, new members can sign up for the remainder of the season by paying a prorated program fee and the club membership fee. The exact amount will be calculated based on how much of the season is left; please reach out to <a href="mailto:info@a2crew.org">info@a2crew.org</a> for details. You must sign up and pay the program fees to continue sculling after your trial period.</p>
