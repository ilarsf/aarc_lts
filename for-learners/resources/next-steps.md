    <h2>Understanding Your Progress</h2>
    <p>During your Learn to Scull program, your coaches helped you develop core competencies. This provides a foundation for choosing your next steps. Remember, everyone progresses at their own pace, and the goal is to find the right pathway for your continued enjoyment and development in sculling.</p>

    <h2>Key Pathway Post-Program</h2>

    <h3>Full Club Membership</h3>

    <p>Becoming a full AARC member grants you access to facilities, and the broader rowing community. Membership is required for ongoing participation in most club activities and programs.</p>

    <h3> Open Sculling Program Trial</h3>
    <p>Highly recommended for all graduates. This multi-week discounted trial period allows you to row in a supervised group setting, further honing your skills and building confidence on the water. It's an excellent bridge from structured lessons to more independent rowing. This trial phase requires payment of a program fee; please see the <a href="https://aarc.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=757878&module_id=201828">AARC LTS webpage</a> for current fee details. Please note there is no flexibility on which 4 weeks are offered at this rate. The Open Sculling Program is designed to help scullers further develop and master their skills, and is suitable for recent LTS graduates, experienced scullers aiming to refine their technique, and adults returning to the sport of rowing after a long hiatus.</p>
    <p>The <strong>multi-week discounted trial period</strong> in the Open Sculling Program is the most common and recommended next step. It provides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular, supervised water time.</li>
        <li>Opportunity to row with other recent graduates and experienced members.</li>
        <li>Continued informal coaching and guidance.</li>
        <li>A chance to become comfortable with club routines and equipment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your LTS coaches will provide details on how to sign up for this trial during your final session.</p>
