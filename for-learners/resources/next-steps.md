    <h2>Understanding Your Progress</h2>
    <p>During your Learn to Scull program, your coaches helped you develop core competencies. This provides a foundation for choosing your next steps. Remember, everyone progresses at their own pace, and the goal is to find the right pathway for your continued enjoyment and development in sculling.</p>

    <h2>Key Pathway Post-Program</h2>

    <h3>Full Club Membership</h3>

    <p>Becoming a full AARC member grants you access to facilities, and the broader rowing community. Membership is required for ongoing participation in most club activities and programs.</p>

    <h3> Open Sculling Program Trial</h3>
    <p>Highly recommended for all graduates. This multi-week discounted trial period allows you to row in a supervised group setting, further honing your skills and building confidence on the water. It's an excellent bridge from structured lessons to more independent rowing.</p>
    <p>The <strong>multi-week discounted trial period</strong> in the Open Sculling Program is the most common and recommended next step. It provides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular, supervised water time.</li>
        <li>Opportunity to row with other recent graduates and experienced members.</li>
        <li>Continued informal coaching and guidance.</li>
        <li>A chance to become comfortable with club routines and equipment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your LTS coaches will provide details on how to sign up for this trial during your final session.</p>
