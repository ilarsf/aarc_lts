**Best for:** Documents that recipients might need to customize

## Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Consider using multiple formats for different purposes:

1. **For Coaches:**
   - Google Drive folder with editable Google Docs for collaboration
   - PDF versions for printing and official reference
   - Private webpage access for mobile viewing during sessions

2. **For Learners:**
   - Public webpage with all learner materials
   - PDF downloads option for offline reference
   - QR codes on printed materials linking to online resources

3. **For Administration:**
   - GitHub repository for version control and source files
   - Google Drive for operational documents

## Tools for Conversion

1. **Pandoc** - Command line tool for converting between document formats
   ```bash
   # Install on macOS
   brew install pandoc

   # Basic conversion
   pandoc input.md -o output.pdf
   ```

2. **Markdown to Google Docs**
   - Copy-paste with "Paste without formatting" then manually format
   - Use Google Docs add-ons like "Docs to Markdown" (reversed process)

3. **Website Creation from Markdown**
   - GitHub Pages (automatic with repository)
   - Jekyll with markdown support
   - GitBook for documentation-style websites

## Distribution Workflow Suggestion

1. Maintain markdown as the source of truth in GitHub
2. Automate conversion to multiple formats when files change
3. Upload/update Google Drive versions monthly or as needed
4. Generate PDFs for official distribution
5. Update website content from the same source

For your AARC Learn to Scull program, a combination of a simple website for learners and Google Drive for coaches would provide the best balance of accessibility and maintainability.
