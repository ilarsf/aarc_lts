<div class="info-box tip">
  <h3>Proper Equipment Setup</h3>
  <p>Proper equipment adjustments are crucial for rower comfort, safety, and technical development. This guide will help you make appropriate adjustments for participants of varying sizes and abilities.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Safety first</strong> - All adjustments must prioritize rower safety</li>
        <li><strong>Comfort enables learning</strong> - Uncomfortable rowers cannot focus on technique</li>
        <li><strong>Progressive adaptation</strong> - Begin with more stable settings, then adjust as skills develop</li>
        <li><strong>Individual needs</strong> - Consider body proportions, not just height</li>
        <li><strong>Check before each row</strong> - Verify key adjustments before each session</li>

      <h4>Adjustment Process:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Have rower sit in boat with legs extended and back at finish position</li>
        <li>Adjust distance so knees have slight bend at finish</li>
        <li>Have rower slide to catch position to verify shins position</li>
        <li>Make incremental changes (1cm at a time)</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Measurement:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Measure from top of seat to top of oarlock (with spacers installed)</li>
        <li>Standard height: 16-18cm depending on boat model</li>
        <li>Record in boat logbook once optimal setting found</li>
