## Coaching Notes

### Detailed Drill Explanations

#### Reverse Pick Drill (Water)
- **Execution:** Start with:
  1. Legs-only strokes (maintaining forward body lean and straight arms) - 10 strokes
  2. Progress to legs-and-back swing - 10 strokes
  3. Then full strokes - 10 strokes
- **Purpose:** Isolates and emphasizes leg drive as the primary power source. Teaches rowers to connect effectively at catch and "hang" their body weight off handles.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Focus on pressure building from feet, maintaining connection through the drive, coordinating legs with back swing.

#### Pivot Turns (One Backing/One Rowing)
- **Execution:** To execute a sharp turn (e.g., 180 degrees):
  1. Gently back water with one oar (pushing handle away, blade feathered or slightly squared)
  2. Take light, arms-only or arms-and-body forward strokes with the other oar
- **Purpose:** Essential skill for maneuvering in confined spaces, turning around buoys, approaching docks, or avoiding obstacles quickly.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Start with minimal pressure on both oars until feeling for the turn develops. Emphasize looking in the direction of the turn.

#### Navigation Practice
- **Execution:** While rowing continuously:
  1. Coach designates points/landmarks to aim for
  2. Rowers practice looking over shoulder every 3-5 strokes
  3. Make small course corrections to maintain line
- **Purpose:** Develops awareness of position on river and builds habit of regular checking.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Emphasize quick glances rather than completely stopping rowing. Maintain technique while performing check.

### Common Technical Issues

#### Drive
- **Error:** Weak leg drive / Primarily pulling with arms.
  - **Cue:** "Push the foot stretchers away!" "Feel the pressure build from your feet." "Think 'legs' then 'swing' then 'pull.'" (Use Reverse Pick Drill)
- **Error:** Bum shoving (seat moves back before shoulders/handle).
  - **Cue:** "Connect the legs and back together." "Maintain forward body angle during initial leg push." "Think 'hang' off the handle."
- **Error:** Opening the back too early in the drive.
  - **Cue:** "Legs are halfway down BEFORE you swing the back." (Use Reverse Pick Drill)

#### Steering
- **Error:** Not looking over shoulder frequently enough.
  - **Cue:** "Look every 3-5 strokes â€“ check your point, check for traffic!" Reinforce *why*: safety and maintaining course.
- **Error:** Oversteering or weaving side-to-side.
  - **Cue:** "Make small, gentle corrections." "Pick a fixed point far ahead and aim for it."

#### Traffic Pattern
- **Error:** Consistently rowing on the wrong (port) side of the river.
  - **Coach Intervention:** "Stop rowing! Check your position. Move to the starboard side NOW." Reinforce the pattern.
- **Error:** Cutting corners on turns, not following established pattern.
  - **Cue:** "Take wide turns." "Follow the shoreline curve (at a safe distance)."

### Safety Considerations
- Many participants will struggle to look over their shoulders while maintaining rowing form
- Make looking around while rowing a specific focus point in this session
- Consider dedicated drills where rowers take a few strokes, then pause to look around
- Gradually build to looking while rowing without stopping
- Monitor weather conditions and water traffic throughout the session

### Teaching Tips
- When teaching leg drive, use simple analogies like "pushing a car" or "leg press machine"
- The feeling of connection between foot stretcher and handle is more important than generating maximum power
- Acknowledge that many find steering challenging while maintaining technique - it comes with practice
- Use positive reinforcement for those demonstrating good navigation awareness
