# Session 2: Hitting the Water - Basic Stroke Sequencing

<div class="info-box tip">
  <h4>Session Overview</h4>
  <p>This second session transitions participants from ergometer to on-water rowing, focusing on applying the stroke sequence they learned in Session 1 to the boat environment. The session emphasizes proper recovery sequence and basic boat control.</p>

## Coaching Notes

### Detailed Drill Explanations

#### Pick Drill (Water)
- **Execution:** Mirrors the erg drill but performed in the boat. Start with:
  1. Arms-only rowing from the finish (10 strokes)
  2. Progress to arms-and-body rowing (10 strokes)
  3. Add half-slide (10 strokes)
  4. Finally full-slide rowing (10 strokes)
- **Purpose:** Transfers the learned recovery sequence from stable erg to unstable boat, building confidence and control incrementally.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Focus on clean hand movement away from body first, then body pivot before knees bend. Emphasize patience and smooth transitions.

#### Pause Drills (Arms Away, Body Over)
- **Execution:** Rowers execute stroke normally but insert a distinct pause (approx. 2 seconds) at specific points:
  - **Arms Away Pause:** Pause immediately after release, once hands have cleared knees
  - **Body Over Pause:** Pause after arms are extended and body has pivoted forward, before knees bend
- **Purpose:** Enhances body awareness and control during recovery. Explicitly teaches correct sequence, preventing common errors like early knee bend.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Use distinct verbal cadence: "Pull... Away... (pause)... Body... (pause)... Slide..." to help rowers internalize timing.

#### Basic Turning (One Arm)
- **Execution:** While moving, rower takes gentle strokes with the oar on the *outside* of desired turn, while the oar on the *inside* of the turn trails in water or takes very light strokes.
- **Purpose:** Teaches fundamental boat control, allowing directional changes safely and effectively.
- **Key Coaching Points:** Keep movements gentle and controlled. Turning oar stroke length can be adjusted to control turning radius. Emphasize looking in the direction of turn.

### Common Technical Issues

#### Sequencing
- **Error:** Bending knees before hands are away/body is over.
  - **Cue:** "Hands away FIRST." "Body pivots, THEN knees bend." (Use Pause Drills)
- **Error:** Rushing the slide (moving too quickly towards the stern).
  - **Cue:** "Slow the slide, feel the boat glide." "Control the speed." (Use Pause Drills)

#### Balance
- **Error:** Tensing up, high shoulders, gripping oars tightly.
  - **Cue:** "Relax shoulders down." "Breathe." "Light grip, let the oarlocks work."
- **Error:** Uneven hand heights causing boat tilt.
  - **Cue:** "Keep hands level on recovery." "Left hand slightly above right during crossover."

#### Blade Work
- **Error:** Catching crabs (oar gets stuck underwater).
  - **Cue:** "Focus on smooth sequence." "Square the blade just before entry." "Tap down cleanly at finish."

### Safety Considerations
- Watch for signs of frustration when participants are adjusting to the unstable boat
- Normalize the experience of wobbling and emphasize that balance develops with practice
- Be ready to offer extra support to those who are particularly nervous
- Maintain close proximity for quick assistance if needed
- Monitor weather conditions throughout the session

## Materials to Distribute
- Reminder sheets on stroke sequence
- River traffic pattern diagrams (preview for Session 3)
- Hand care information (for developing blisters)
