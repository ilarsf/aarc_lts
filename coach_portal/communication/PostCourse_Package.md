* Follow all club procedures for signing out equipment
* Complete the logbook entry before and after each row

## Safety Guidelines

Safety is the top priority at AARC. Remember these important guidelines:

* **Visibility:** Always wear bright, high-visibility clothing (neon yellow, orange, red) on the water
* **Logbook:** Sign boats out and in for every practice in the boathouse logbook
* **Equipment Care:** Report any damage to boats to the Boathouse Manager as soon as possible using the Equipment/repair report form
* **Weather Awareness:** Check conditions before rowing and follow AARC weather guidelines
* **River Traffic:** Follow established traffic patterns and yield appropriately to other vessels
* **Communication:** Carry a phone in a waterproof case when rowing independently

Independent use of club sculling equipment is a privilege granted only to members who consistently demonstrate proper safety techniques. Any actions contrary to safety protocols may result in loss of boat use privileges.

* AARC attends local, regional, and national regattas during summer and fall
* Racing opportunities are available for all skill levels and ages
* Interested members should inquire about regatta participation
* Training for competition may require additional commitment

1. **Technique Refinement:** Work on fluid, efficient movement
2. **Extended Endurance:** Gradually increase your continuous rowing time
3. **Blade Control:** Master the feathering and squaring motions
4. **Power Application:** Develop effective power transfer to the oar
5. **Navigation Confidence:** Build comfort with river traffic patterns
