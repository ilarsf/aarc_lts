# Using the Communication Resources

This guide provides instructions for AARC coaches and administrators on how to effectively use the communication resources for the Learn to Scull program.

## Communication Strategy Overview

Effective communication is critical to the success of the Learn to Scull program. Our communication strategy includes:

1. **Pre-Course Communication:** Setting expectations and providing essential information
2. **Session-Specific Updates:** Preparing participants for each session
3. **Post-Session Follow-ups:** Reinforcing learning and preparing for the next session 
4. **Post-Course Engagement:** Encouraging continued participation with AARC

## How to Use the Email Templates

### Customizing Templates

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Identify all text in [brackets] and replace with specific information
2. **Personal Touch:** Add a brief personalized note where appropriate
3. **Consistency Check:** Ensure dates, times, and locations are consistent across all communications
4. **Links Verification:** Test all links before sending to ensure they work properly

### Timing Guidelines

- **Welcome Email:** Send exactly 1 week before the first session
- **Final Reminder:** Send the day before Session 1, preferably in the morning
- **Session Prep Emails:** Send the evening before each session (typically by 7:00 PM)
- **Post-Session Emails:** Send the same day after each session (within a few hours)
- **Post-Course Communications:** Send the evaluation request 2-3 days after the final session

### Email Personalization Tips

- **Use Names:** Always address participants by their first name
- **Highlight Individual Progress:** When possible, mention specific achievements
- **Tailor Content:** Adjust email content based on group progress and specific challenges
- **Coach Signature:** Include your name, role, and contact information

## Using the Information Packages

### When to Share Information Packages

| Package | When to Share | Method |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Intro Package | Registration confirmation | Include link in confirmation email |
| Session 1 Package | One week before Session 1 | Include link in welcome email |
| Session 2 Package | After Session 1 | Include link in post-Session 1 email |
| Session 3 Package | After Session 2 | Include link in post-Session 2 email |
| Session 4 Package | After Session 3 | Include link in post-Session 3 email |
| Post-Course Package | After Session 4 | Include link in evaluation request email |

### Customizing Information Packages

While the content of the information packages is standardized, you may want to highlight specific sections based on your observation of participant needs:

1. **Identify Challenge Areas:** After each session, note common challenges faced by participants
2. **Reference Specific Sections:** In your emails, direct participants to specific sections of the information packages that address these challenges
3. **Add Context:** Explain how the information relates to what was observed during the session

## Using Quiz Resources

The Learn to Scull program includes interactive quizzes that serve as valuable tools for both participants and coaches:

### Participant Benefits
- Reinforces key concepts from each session
- Provides immediate feedback on knowledge comprehension
- Offers a convenient way to review material between sessions

### Coach Benefits
- Helps identify knowledge gaps among participants
- Creates accountability for reviewing materials
- Provides objective assessment data

### How to Incorporate Quizzes
1. **Pre-Course Preparation**: Include links to the Boathouse Rules and Safety Guidelines quizzes in welcome emails
2. **Session Reinforcement**: Send quiz links in post-session emails to reinforce learning
3. **Knowledge Assessment**: Use quiz results to identify topics needing additional attention
4. **Learning Retention**: Encourage participants to retake quizzes periodically after course completion

### Quiz Schedule Recommendations
- **Before First Session**: Boathouse Rules and Safety Guidelines quizzes
- **After Each Session**: Corresponding session quiz
- **Post-Course**: Encourage review of all quizzes as needed

### Technical Notes
- Quizzes are accessible via web browser on mobile devices and computers
- No login required - easy access for all participants
- Results are not tracked or stored - quizzes are for participant self-assessment only

The quiz resources are seamlessly integrated with the information packages, with links provided in each relevant package document.

## Communication Best Practices

### Tone and Style

- **Friendly but Professional:** Maintain a supportive tone while conveying competence
- **Clear and Concise:** Keep communications brief but comprehensive
- **Consistent Voice:** Maintain a consistent style across all communications
- **Positive Framing:** Focus on progress and opportunities for improvement

### Special Scenarios

1. **Weather Cancellations:** Use the Weather Email Templates for consistent messaging
2. **Participant Concerns:** Address individual concerns privately via direct email or phone
3. **Group-Wide Issues:** Address common challenges in the group emails, focusing on constructive solutions

### Following Up

- **Check Receipt:** For critical communications (like cancellations), confirm receipt if possible
- **Monitor Responses:** Pay attention to questions or concerns raised in response to your emails
- **Track Engagement:** Note which participants may need additional outreach or support

## Program Schedule and Planning

Use the [2025 Program Schedule](2025_Program_Schedule.html) as your master reference for planning communications. The schedule includes:

- Session dates and times
- Registration deadlines
- Communication milestones
- Key contact information

## Technical Tips

1. **Email Client:** Use an email client that supports templates to save time
2. **Contact Groups:** Create email groups for each class to streamline communication
3. **Scheduling:** Consider scheduling emails in advance for consistent timing
4. **Backup Contacts:** Always have a phone number for urgent communications (like day-of cancellations)
5. **Document Sharing:** Use PDF attachments for forms that need to be completed

Remember that consistent, clear communication builds trust with participants and contributes significantly to their learning experience and satisfaction with the program.
