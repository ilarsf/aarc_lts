# Session 3: Refining Your Technique

You're now halfway through your Learn to Scull program! In Sessions 1 and 2, you built a foundation of basic rowing skills. Session 3 will focus on refining your technique and introducing more advanced concepts.

## Sessions 1 & 2 Recap

So far, you've accomplished:
* Participated in water safety training
* Learned basic boat handling and equipment care
* Developed foundational rowing technique
* Experienced the basic sculling stroke sequence
* Practiced maintaining balance in the boat

### Flip Test Status

As we enter the second weekend of training, please be aware of your flip test status:

* **Already Completed:** If you've already successfully completed the flip test, fantastic!
* **Still Needed:** If you haven't completed the flip test yet, you have two more sessions to do so. Successful completion is required for program graduation and participation in the Open Sculling Program.
* **Today's Opportunity:** If you would like to attempt or re-attempt the flip test during Session 3, please inform your coach at the beginning of the session. We typically schedule this toward the end of the session.
* **Support Available:** Don't worry if you're feeling nervous - our coaches are experienced in helping participants successfully complete this important safety requirement.

## Session 3 Focus Areas

In this third session, we'll focus on refining your skills:

* **Blade Work:** Mastering the square and feather positions of the blades
* **Stroke Refinement:** Developing a more fluid, connected stroke
* **Power Application:** Learning to apply power effectively through the drive phase
* **Steering:** More advanced steering techniques
* **Boat Run:** Understanding how to maximize the glide of the boat

## Common Technical Challenges

As you develop your skills, watch for these common technical issues:

* **Rushing the Slide:** Moving too quickly during the recovery phase
* **Digging Too Deep:** Submerging the oars too deeply in the water
* **Early Body Swing:** Opening the back before completing the leg drive
* **Skying:** Approaching the catch with blades too high above the water
* **Uneven Pressure:** Applying more force with one arm than the other

Your coach will help you identify and correct these issues during Session 3.

## Technical Tip: The Catch

The "catch" is the moment when your blades enter the water, and it's crucial for an effective stroke:
* Approach with blades just above the water surface
* Keep arms straight and body pivoted forward from the hips
* Place the blades cleanly into the water with a quick downward motion of the hands
* Begin the drive immediately once the blades are buried

For visual reference, check the [Catch Position video](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/course_materials/learner/QA_Companion.html#videos-tab) in our resource library.

## Preparing for Session 3

To make the most of your third session:

* **Review Terminology:** Familiarize yourself with rowing terms from the [Rowing Terminology guide](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/course_materials/learner/technical/Rowing_Terminology.html)
* **Hand Care:** Continue proper blister management
* **Mental Preparation:** Visualization can help - imagine yourself performing smooth, coordinated strokes
* **Physical Preparation:** Light stretching, especially for shoulders, back, and legs

## What to Bring

The same essential items:
* Water bottle
* Athletic clothing
* **Bright Colors:** Wear bright, high-visibility clothing (neon yellow, orange, red) for safety on the water
* Sun protection
* Hand care supplies
* Small snack

## Session 3 Quiz

To reinforce what you've learned in this session, we encourage you to complete the Session 3 quiz:

This quiz will help you evaluate your understanding of more advanced sculling techniques and concepts covered today.

## Looking Ahead

By the end of Session 3, your stroke should be more refined and coordinated. Session 4 will focus on building your independence as a sculler, including launching and docking on your own, and preparing you for continuing with the club after the program ends.

*Remember that learning to row is a journey - each person progresses at their own pace. Focus on improvement rather than perfection!*
