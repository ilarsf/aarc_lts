# Session 1: Getting Started with Sculling

Welcome to your first Learn to Scull session! This guide will prepare you for what to expect in your first class and help you arrive ready to learn.

## Session 1 Focus Areas

In this initial session, we'll cover:

* **Orientation & Safety:** Boathouse rules, equipment introduction, and safety procedures
* **Basic Rowing Motion:** Initial technique instruction using ergometers (rowing machines)
* **Equipment Handling:** How to safely carry and handle boats and oars
* **Water Safety:** The essential "flip test" to practice capsize recovery
* **First Strokes:** If time permits, your first guided strokes on the water

## The Flip Test - What to Expect

The flip test is a mandatory, supervised drill where you'll practice what to do if your boat capsizes. Here's what to know:

* **You will get wet** - plan accordingly with a towel and change of clothes
* **It's completely safe** - coaches will guide and supervise you throughout
* **Everyone does it** - all rowers must be comfortable with water safety
* **It builds confidence** - knowing you can recover from a capsize is empowering!

### Key Steps in the Flip Test:

1. **Stay Calm & Stay With Your Boat:** Your shell provides buoyancy
2. **Manage Oars:** Keep them nearby; they help stabilize for re-entry
3. **Right the Shell:** If upside down, gently flip it back over
4. **Position Oars:** Arrange oars perpendicular to the boat for stability
5. **Re-Enter:** Use your legs to boost yourself back into the boat

For a preview of what this looks like, review the [Flip Test demonstration videos](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/course_materials/learner/QA_Companion.html#videos-tab) and the [Self-Rescue Guide](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/course_materials/learner/safety/Self_Rescue_Guide.html).

## Essential Items to Bring

* **Water Bottle:** At least 1 liter (32 oz)
* **Athletic Clothing:** Form-fitting, non-cotton items that won't catch in the tracks
* **Bright Colors:** Wear bright, ideally high-visibility clothing (neon yellow, orange, red) for safety on the water
* **Sun Protection:** Hat, sunglasses, and waterproof sunscreen
* **Towel & Change of Clothes:** For after the flip test
* **Completed Forms:** AARC and USRowing waivers
* **Small Snack:** For energy during the session
* **Hand Care Items:** Optional athletic tape if you're prone to blisters

## What to Expect Physically

* Rowing engages many muscle groups - expect to use muscles you might not normally use!
* Hand blisters are common for beginners - we'll cover prevention techniques
* Balance is a challenge at first - the boats are designed to be narrow and tippy
* You'll need to bend low to get into and out of the boat

## Next Steps

* Review the [AARC Safety Rules](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/src/AARC_Safety_Rules.pdf) before arriving
* Watch our [Introduction to Sculling Technique video](https://ilarsf.github.io/aarc_lts/course_materials/learner/QA_Companion.html#videos-tab) if available
* Get a good night's sleep before your session
* Arrive 15 minutes early for your first session for proper orientation

## Session 1 Quiz

To reinforce what you've learned in this session, we encourage you to complete the Session 1 quiz:
