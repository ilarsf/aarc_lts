# Weather Assessment Guide

This guide provides comprehensive protocols for evaluating weather and water conditions to ensure safe rowing. Coaches should conduct thorough assessments before each session and continuously monitor conditions while on the water.

<div class="info-box aarc mb-3">
  <h4>Coach Responsibility</h4>
  <p>Safety is the primary responsibility of all coaches. When in doubt about weather conditions, always err on the side of caution. No practice session is worth risking participant safety.</p>

  <h4>Critical Safety Rule</h4>
  <p>Lightning/thunder safety protocol overrides all other considerations. If lightning is seen or thunder heard, all boats must be off the water for at least 30 minutes after the last observed lightning or thunder.</p>
</div>

## Pre-Session Assessment Procedure

### 1. Weather Forecast Review

**Sources to Check:**
- National Weather Service forecast
- Weather app with hourly radar tracking
- Local weather alerts and warnings
- Weather radio (if available)

**Elements to Evaluate:**
- **Current Conditions:** Temperature, wind, precipitation, visibility
- **Forecast Timeline:** Expected changes during session duration
- **Approaching Systems:** Fronts, storms, or significant changes
- **Radar Imagery:** Location and movement of precipitation
- **Warnings/Advisories:** Any official statements from weather services

### 2. On-Site Visual Assessment

**Location:** Perform assessment from dock area with clear view of rowing course

**Elements to Evaluate:**
- **Wind Conditions:** Direction, strength, gusting patterns
- **Water Surface:** Chop height, whitecaps, wave patterns
- **Current:** Speed and direction, eddy patterns
- **Sky Conditions:** Cloud formations, approaching precipitation
- **Visibility:** Distance markers, fog banks, haze
- **Debris:** Presence and size of floating material

### 3. Instrumentation Check

**Tools to Use:**
- Wind meter/anemometer
- Thermometer for air temperature
- Water temperature gauge
- Weather station (if available at boathouse)

**Measurements to Record:**
- Wind speed and direction
- Air temperature
- Water temperature
- Combined temperature index (air + water)

### 4. Documentation

- Record assessment results in coaching log
- Note decision made and rationale
- Document changing conditions during session
- Report any concerning patterns to boathouse management

## Decision-Making Framework

### Green Flag Conditions (Safe)
- All conditions in "Safe to Row" column
- Clear forecast for session duration
- No weather warnings/watches
- Stable or improving conditions

**Response:** Proceed with normal session as planned.

### Yellow Flag Conditions (Caution)
- One or more conditions in "Use Caution" column
- Forecast showing potential deterioration during session
- Isolated weather watches in region
- Conditions at threshold levels

**Possible Responses:**
- Modify session plan to stay closer to boathouse
- Use more stable boat classes
- Increase coach-to-rower ratio
- Implement specific safety briefing
- Shorten session duration
- Consider individual rower experience levels

### Red Flag Conditions (Do Not Row)
- Any condition in "Do Not Row" column
- Severe weather watches/warnings
- Rapidly deteriorating conditions
- Multiple caution thresholds exceeded
- Lightning/thunder observed or imminent

**Response:** Cancel on-water session, substitute land training.

## Special Considerations for Learn to Scull Programs

### Novice Rower Factors

**Adjust Thresholds:**
- Reduce wind thresholds by 2-3 mph
- Be more conservative with water temperature minimums
- Consider smaller visibility buffer
- Account for limited self-rescue capabilities

**Equipment Considerations:**
- Use most stable singles available
- Ensure all boats have enhanced flotation
- Have additional safety launches prepared

**Program Modifications:**
- Plan alternative land-based activities
- Have contingency drills prepared
- Brief all participants on weather protocols

### Cold Weather Protocols

**When Air/Water Below Cautionary Levels:**
- Require additional clothing layers
- Decrease time on water
- Maintain closer supervision
- Brief on hypothermia signs/symptoms
- Position safety launches strategically
- Implement buddy system

### Hot Weather Protocols

**When Temperatures Exceed 90°F:**
- Schedule sessions for cooler parts of day
- Require hydration before/during sessions
- Provide shade breaks
- Monitor for heat illness signs
- Have cooling resources available
- Consider shorter sessions

## On-Water Monitoring and Response

### Continuous Assessment

**Monitor:**
- Changing cloud formations
- Shifting wind patterns
- Darkening horizon
- Sudden temperature changes
- Altered water surface conditions

**Assessment Frequency:**
- Every 15-30 minutes in stable conditions
- Every 5-10 minutes in marginal conditions
- Constant monitoring when weather is approaching cautionary thresholds

### Communication Procedures

**With Rowers:**
- Establish clear hand signals for weather alerts
- Use whistle system for rapid recall
- Brief on specific expected weather changes
- Designate weather observation responsibility

**With Other Coaches:**
- Share observations via radio/phone
- Coordinate response plans
- Agree on thresholds for session termination
- Designate lead decision-maker

### Emergency Response

**For Sudden Weather Change:**
1. Signal immediate return to boathouse
2. If return impossible, direct to nearest safe shore point
3. Account for all participants
4. Implement appropriate shelter plan
5. Maintain communication with boathouse
6. Document incident and response

## Post-Session Review

- Document actual conditions encountered
- Note any discrepancies between forecast and reality
- Record any adaptations made to session plan
- Identify opportunities for improved assessment
- Share relevant observations with other coaches
- Update weather assessment protocols as needed
